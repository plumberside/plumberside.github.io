It is one of the most common screens installed in the neighborhood and fits most consumer needs. Nevertheless, we are happy to discuss what you want to obtain from a disposal and make sure that we provide the right option.</p>
<p>A. Typically wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak coming from below the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" unnoticed issue. Try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
<p>A clogged or broken toilet can cause severe interruptions to your house. At Magic Plumbing we work to guarantee our homeowners are never ever without this essential service.
