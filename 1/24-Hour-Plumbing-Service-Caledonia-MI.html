<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a few things you can do to keep your drains clear. Avoid putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We suggest natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work much better than products consisting of severe chemicals and won't cause damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>In addition to water softening systems, Rinckey said that reverse osmosis systems (ROs) are quite popular with homeowners in the area. He kept in mind that there are specific contaminants that homeowners are handling and an RO can help minimize those issues. Due to being mostly agricultural in Montcalm and Ionia counties, some homeowners are setting up ROs to rid their water source of nitrates that are an item of agricultural waste. Rinckey kept in mind that these systems eliminate around 94 percent of nitrates. Arsenic also naturally takes place in some soils which too can be corrected with the right RO system.</p>
<p>If you have an older house, there's a great chance you have galvanized pipes. And if your house was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are most likely nearing completion of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to rust. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have many negative effects on your health. Rusty pipes likewise lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>For instance, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable television and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done individually. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for up to two hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
