<p>There's a great opportunity you have galvanized pipes if you have an older home. And if your home was integrated in the 1970s or earlier, those pipes are probably nearing the end of their lifespan. As galvanized pipes age, they begin to corrode. This rust can cause an accumulation of lead, which can have numerous unfavorable impacts on your health. Rusty pipes also lead to bad water quality and low water pressure.</p>
<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in an option and is used to reveal the strength of the acidity of an option. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that launch hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, accelerating corrosion Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the development of carbonic acid, thus making the water more corrosive. The presence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
