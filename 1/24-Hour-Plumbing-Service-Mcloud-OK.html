<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water circulates in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on regular water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt since they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, typically regenerate after so many gallons of water have been softened. Such models are practical if you have a changing water use schedule.</p>
