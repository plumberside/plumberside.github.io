<p>These guys were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a fair rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it as well.</p>
