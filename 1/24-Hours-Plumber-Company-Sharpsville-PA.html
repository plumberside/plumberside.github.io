It is important to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the disadvantage shut down stays in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate movement. When the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air needs to be eliminated from the body. The majority of backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.
