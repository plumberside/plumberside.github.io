<h3>Most Common Plumbing Emergencies Pagosa Springs CO</h3>
<p>Split sewer pipes can be more than just a costly repair-- they can lead to extensive and expensive property damage and result in severe health dangers. When a sewer line fails, sewer line repair is the first line of defense. Sewer line replacement is the only other choice if the sewer line can't be fixed. Luckily, Mr. Rooter Â® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>3. Consider a hair-stopper: The number 1 reason our Thousand Oaks drain cleaning experts are called into a home is because there is too much hair in the shower drain. Hair-stoppers are quite inexpensive and simple to install, so there's no reason not to. When grease strengthens it stays with the pipe and avoids water flow, eventually causing a backup. This added with other particles in your drain can cause a major backup.</p>
