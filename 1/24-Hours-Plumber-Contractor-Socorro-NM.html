<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
