<p>Malfunctioning plumbing and components can be more than a problem: It can cost you money in increased water bills and cause structural damage to your house. 10 percent of houses nationwide have leakages in their plumbing that waste more than 90 gallons of water a day, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.
