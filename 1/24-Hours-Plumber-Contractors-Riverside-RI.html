Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled.
