<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older homes were set up with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will rust. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and develops a water resistant membrane to safeguard the iron from rusting.</p>

Our trusted service technicians have the abilities and experience to identify problems in a prompt manner.

That's where the salt water tank is available in. An on-board computer determines the quantity of water that flows through the softener. Regeneration automatically starts when it reaches the preprogrammed setting. For a three-bedroom house and family of 4, regeneration typically happens every 12,000 gallons.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and models of gas hot water heater, electric hot water heater and tankless water heaters.
