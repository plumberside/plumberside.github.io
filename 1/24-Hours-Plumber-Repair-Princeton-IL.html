<h3>Helpful Tips For Selecting A Reputable, Budget Friendly Plumber Princeton IL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed registered designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or several devices, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in extremely unusual cases where the structure is deemed to not posture a danger to the supply of water, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, as well as an initial test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
