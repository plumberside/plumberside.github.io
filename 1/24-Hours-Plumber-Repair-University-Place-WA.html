<p>The economics of new high-efficiency water softeners. The service technician shut off the water supply and loosened up the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet fixture. The client helped our professional in moving the toilet back into its appropriate location, and the service technician tightened the bolts prior to bring back the water system and making sure that the toilet was effectively flushing.</p>
<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you may face. The very first is a check valve. The 2nd is a double check". It is NOT the exact same thing as a Double Check even though it may be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Dual Checks have losses similar to Double Checks (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Denver Water's Cross-Connection Control and Backflow Prevention Program secures the public supply of water from contaminants and impurities that could, under specific circumstances, be drawn into the public supply of water from private properties. The cost mostly depends on the toilet you choose if you need a brand-new toilet. Toilets vary in design, flushing performance and bowl shape, all of which make some toilets more pricey than others. When installing a new toilet, the plumber might also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the overall cost of the job.</p>
