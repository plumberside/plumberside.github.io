It is essential that the repair technician understands the correct installation orientation and can evaluate the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
