<p>It's an excellent concept to have a professional evaluate your drain system if you experience clogs and backups in your home more than a couple of times. A drain professional like TLC will use a camera to check your drain system.

The camera can locate and determine the issue so the drain can be fixed.</p>
<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit declared for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only modify the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of specific systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
