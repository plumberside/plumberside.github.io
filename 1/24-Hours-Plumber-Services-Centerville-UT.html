The repair might be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.
