<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the hardness ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH pull back. When it pertains to pipe repair, the most costly aspects aren't the equipment or materials used, but the landscaping, lawn and uprooting damage that takes place.</p>
