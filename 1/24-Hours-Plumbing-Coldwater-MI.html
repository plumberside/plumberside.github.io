<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester translates the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
