<p>Clearly the resin is not an inexhaustible exchange site. When all the sodium exchange sites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is invested and will no longer soften water. At this point, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regrowth. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use as soon as backwashing is total. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>

Professional drain cleaning with cleanouts is much more reliable at removing obstructions. Lots of homes have drain cleanouts, however, we encounter older houses without cleanouts.
