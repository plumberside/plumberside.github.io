If left unaddressed, minor obstructions can end up being large obstructions, resulting in substantial damage that requires pipe repairs Understanding the reasons for drain and sewer clogs can help you take the essential actions to prevent them.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not needed to obtain this certification. I have actually talked to a couple of plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are usually the result of wood rot. The flange screws merely won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best solution depends on the level of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace an area of the subfloor.</p>
