<p>Manual leak detection for drainage applications is the easiest of the 3 available techniques. Tankless units last 5-10 years longer than tanked systems and require less repairs in time. Sanford & Son plumbing provides sink repair and replacement services to all Lake Elsinore, Temecula, Murrieta, Sun City, Menifee, Wildomar, and surrounding locations. Throughout regeneration, salted water from the brine tank flows up the fill tube and into the softener tank. A rinse cycle commences and the salted water washes the mineral deposits off the resin beads. The regenerated water and the mineral deposits are eliminated the discharge hose. The system then reverts back to softening the incoming water.</p>
