<p>Light Blue = Decreased Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Examine spring (for example, to 90 psi).

<p>Food scraps compose up to 20% of all household waste. This large amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can if it can quickly and quickly be disposed of through the sink. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into small pieces that are capable of taking a trip through the sewage pipes without hampering water circulation. By installing a waste disposal unit you are helping the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other disposing areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through already existing water facilities.</p>
