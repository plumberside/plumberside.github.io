<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is essential that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
<p>Set out the new disposal and parts in preparation for installation. I've been to numerous carwashes that have a softener, and to the surprise of the owners, the water tests hard even after having gone through the softener.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is lowered by the # 1 Examine spring (for instance, to 90 psi).

If pressure in the Zone rises towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, avoiding backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>
