Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, corrosion or collapsed pipes.

<p>Include more warm water if it gradually recedes as you work. Keep plunging up until the drain is clear or you choose it's time to attempt a new approach. Tankless systems link directly to your plumbing and only heat the water as it is required. This leads to savings on your energy expense.
