Salt is manually contributed to the salt water tank in the type of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy salt water service is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the salt water tank runs out of salt.</p>

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in case you have to offer some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're dealing with installing it.
