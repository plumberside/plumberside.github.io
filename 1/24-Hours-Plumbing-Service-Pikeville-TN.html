These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the difficult water minerals. The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
