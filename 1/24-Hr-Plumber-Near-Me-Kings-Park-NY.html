<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of two classifications. Timed designs have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on a predetermined schedule and then return to service. These work well for homes that are on routine water-using cycles but will waste more water and salt because they restore whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control models, with either mechanical and electrical sensors, normally regenerate after a lot of gallons of water have been softened. Such designs are practical if you have an ever-changing water use schedule.</p>
