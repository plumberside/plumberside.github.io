It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I selected this company because they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it too.</p>
