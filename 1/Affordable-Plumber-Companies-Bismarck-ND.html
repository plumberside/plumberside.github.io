<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Day to day usage must not trigger a water softener to leak.

If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, protect the softener so that if the structure begins moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing.
