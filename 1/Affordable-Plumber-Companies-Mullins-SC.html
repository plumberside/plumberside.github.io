<p>Food scraps compose as much as 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big quantity of trash does not need to go in the garbage can. A waste disposal unit works by shredding the waste into tiny pieces that are capable of traveling through the sewage pipes without impeding water circulation. By setting up a garbage disposal you are assisting the environment by saving the amount of trash that gets sent to garbage dumps and other dumping areas. With a garbage disposal the trash is managed through currently existing water infrastructure.</p>
