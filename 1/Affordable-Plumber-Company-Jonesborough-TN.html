<p>Damage control is a problem. As a sewer and drain cleaning company, I run into scenarios, on a regular basis that require a company such as Serve Pro to precede me on the job.

I 'd love to post some photos of this. Simply look on line. The issue does exist.</p>

Opportunities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to address this concern. Call a plumber immediately.</p>
