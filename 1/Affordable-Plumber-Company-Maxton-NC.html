<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind versus a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
