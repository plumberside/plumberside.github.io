<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the hard water flows through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the difficult water minerals. The tough water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Storage facility likewise carries a wide assortment of backflow prevention accessories. These devices include backflow prevention system attachments, backflow device enclosures, test packages, repair parts, and insulated pouches.
