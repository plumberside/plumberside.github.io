<p>Surface Area Accelerated Crystallization is an invention that simulates biomineralization, the system frequently acknowledged for structured growth in the environment, including seashells. Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the growth of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally eliminate short-lived solidity in water.</p>
<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the culprit. But not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause difficulty too. Image 3 shows how to set the slack perfect.</p>
