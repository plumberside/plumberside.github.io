The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test data suggests for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
