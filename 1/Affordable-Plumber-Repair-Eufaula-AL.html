<h3>What To Do First When I Need An Emergency Plumber Near Me Eufaula AL</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the past. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The price was rather reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>

<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling.
