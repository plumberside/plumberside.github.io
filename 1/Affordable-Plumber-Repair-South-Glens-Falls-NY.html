<h3>Residential Plumbing Contractor South Glens Falls NY</h3>
<p>These people were incredible! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great task cleaning up after it too.</p>
