The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; hardness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft water supply is free of hardness ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a kind of water filter needing regular cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is a procedure in which the sewer pipes are scrubbed clean by streams of high-pressure water shooting from a hose at as much as 3,500 PSI. This enables the sewer lines to be cleaned quickly and effectively with high-velocity water pressure. The streams of high-pressure water, producing from the forward and reverse jets in the nozzle, propel the hose through the line to remove debris such as tough water scale, silt, grease, and sand deposits.</p>
