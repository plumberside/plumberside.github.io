<p>After professional drain cleaning, there are a couple of things you can do to keep your drains clear. Prevent putting grease or oil down the drains. Use a solution of baking soda and vinegar regularly to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can utilize a natural drain cleaner monthly to keep your drains clear. We advise organic items, such as Bio-Clean, due to the fact that they work better than items containing harsh chemicals and won't trigger damage to your drains or components.</p>
<p>If a cable television has not yet been gone to the junction box, you can make the connections within the new disposer at any time beforehand, joining the cable to the wires in package right before or simply after mounting the disposer. Waste disposal unit are quite simple to keep. The most essential thing to keep in mind is that they are truly food disposals.

This includes glass, plastic, metals (yes, silverware), paper, anything combustible, bleach, drain cleaners, and toys.</p>
<p>Hydro jetting is one of many trenchless services offered to you, available via North Georgia Inliner.
