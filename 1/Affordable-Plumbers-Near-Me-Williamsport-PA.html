<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Storage facility likewise carries a large assortment of backflow prevention devices.

<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
