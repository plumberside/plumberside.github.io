<p>Foul Sewer Smell: One of the first most obvious indications of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the yard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a basic issue such as a broken water seal, or it can suggest a bigger problem such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house.

<p>In addition to backflow prevention valves, Sprinkler Storage facility likewise carries a large assortment of backflow prevention devices.

<p>Letters are sent out to residential consumers with known backflow devices on a yearly basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Depending upon the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
