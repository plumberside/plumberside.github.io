<h3>Things To Know Before Hiring A Sewer Cleaning Company at Estacada OR 97023</h3>

Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
