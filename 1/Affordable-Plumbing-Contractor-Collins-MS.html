<p>Organic debris, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself project. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
<p>Your house's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the flow of water pushing them down your pipes. Instead, once they go down your drain, gravity takes control of as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. Anything you put down there won't go through when something obstructs the pipes.</p>
