<p>Nearly all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regrow on a predetermined schedule and after that return to service. These work well for households that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt because they regrow whether the resin requires it or not. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensing units, normally regenerate after so many gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water utilize schedule, such designs are convenient.</p>
