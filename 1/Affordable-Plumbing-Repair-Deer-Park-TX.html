<p>Leaks are sly. You have most likely seen drain cleaner items on the racks at your local house improvement store, so when your drain gets clogged or isn't draining water like it should, you might be lured to head down there and pick some up to fix it by yourself. These products, after all, make the procedure appear quite basic. Sadly it's not as easy as you might believe, and those items are not always going to fix the issue.
