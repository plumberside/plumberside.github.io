<p>When they have to fit local water and sewer capabilities, Garbage disposal units might cost more. The plumbing in the house must work well or backup can take place, and septic tanks may need to be upgraded to deal with the disposal. Baffles: Baffles prevent silverware from going into the garbage disposal, so you're just sending out food and compostable waste down the drain.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some individuals's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind versus a stationary mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
