<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, carefully listen and lift the rod. If the water shuts off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>It is essential that all aspects of your gas lines remain in excellent condition. The state of the pipe is important. As is the connection to your device and equipment. If any of these are an issue, there is the capacity for gas leakages and even fire. When a Notice of Correction" or Notification of Requirement" is released, failure to install or remedy an installation and then evaluate a backflow assembly might lead to service interruption or termination.</p>
