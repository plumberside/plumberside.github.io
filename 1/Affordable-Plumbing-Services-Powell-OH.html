<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a viable option, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. Nevertheless, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous items - not least of which is that they normally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
