As difficult water travels through the mineral tank, the beads inside attract the positively-charged calcium and magnesium ions. The minerals that trigger hard water stay with the beads, and the treated water goes out into your home's plumbing system.</p>
<p>Water supplied by the water company consists of some amounts of hazardous chemicals like arsenic and lead. Water filtration systems remove these pollutants to make drinking water clean, clear and tastier. As such, water filtration systems are important requirements, not optional costs.
