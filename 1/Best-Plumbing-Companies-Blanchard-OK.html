<h2>Tips To Hire Certified Plumbing Company in Blanchard</h2>
<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the homes in our area were built before 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water ended up being standard. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This deterioration, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and end up being flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Is your home 50+ years old? Up through the mid-twentieth century, galvanized steel was the primary material used in plumbing. While galvanized steel is strong, it typically succumbs to deterioration after about 50 years and needs replacement. Much more contemporary pipes will not last permanently, so keep an eye on plumbing systems that might be reaching the end of their life expectancy.</p>
