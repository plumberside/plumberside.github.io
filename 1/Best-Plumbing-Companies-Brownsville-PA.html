<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves must avoid backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A basic manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However most of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>The report will utilize one or both of these systems to inform you how tough your water is if you have your water tested.

<p>Backflow is the unwanted turnaround of circulation of water which may bring dirty water or other, harmful substances into the general public water system and private plumbing. Backflow can happen in a variety of situations that might draw water from places such as garden fountains, pool, or sprinkler system systems into City water system lines. Backflow can also carry water into your plumbing if it is connected to any outside water source. One example would be a garden hose linked to an external faucet with the end left in a mud puddle in a garden area.</p>

<p>Sometimes, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester translates the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
