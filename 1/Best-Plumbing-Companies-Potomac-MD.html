<p>The old disposal needs to be disconnected initially. Waste disposal unit are generally connected at the base and so this is where the process begins. Some electrical understanding is required to guarantee the wires are disconnected properly. Answer: No! They do not have a sprinkler system, or any outdoor watering system at all, so they do not need backflow prevention.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the 2 redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
