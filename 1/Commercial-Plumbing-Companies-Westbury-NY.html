Another tip to stop blocking is to look out for excess grease and oils.

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
