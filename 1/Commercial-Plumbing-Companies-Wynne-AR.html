If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you should wait up until after the cycle is completed and then checked the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also check to ensure your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
