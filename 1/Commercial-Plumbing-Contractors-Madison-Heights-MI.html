<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Promises? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

Examine to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be warmed and readily available for usage.
