<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also called tree root intrusion. When tree roots start to make their method inside someone's main sewer line, there is capacity for this to trigger drain problems. The type of drain pipes currently set up, such as cast iron, copper, plastic or clay, will figure out the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
