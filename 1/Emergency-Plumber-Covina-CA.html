<p>A video camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to collect your backyard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain professional runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bathtubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can pinpoint any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
