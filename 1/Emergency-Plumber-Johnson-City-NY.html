<p>Gently listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>There are health and safety risks one should avoid while working on a sewer line project. Methane gas, salmonella, e. coli, giardia - all are discovered in sewer pipes and may expose workers throughout the sewer repair procedure. If your Do It Yourself dig hits a gas line, breathing the gas can damage your body, and there is a danger of fire or explosion damage to your home or your neighbor's. Another danger in sewer repair tasks is the collapse of earth from the walls around the dig site. Your safety and health are too essential to risk in a Do It Yourself sewer task!
