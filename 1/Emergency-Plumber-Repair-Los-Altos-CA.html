Merely put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Much of these cleaners consist of focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be really harmful if it is available in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. Please ensure to take the proper safety measures if using one of these products.</p>
