Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
