Some toilets, however, have actually distinctively shaped bowls and need a particular seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It truly isn't a good idea to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have actually been particularly created to fit typical toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and trigger you to move around, or will not distribute your weight equally and might ultimately trigger fractures in the bowl.</p>
