<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become fragile. This results in micro-fractures and lowers the basic structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is likewise a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly difficult to spot.</p>
<p>City of Bellingham examines backflow assemblies upon installation and conducts periodic re-inspections on all existing assemblies. New assemblies need to be evaluated by a State of Washington certified Backflow Assembly Tester prior to taking into service. A copy of the test report must be provided to the City of Bellingham.

<p>Light Blue = Minimized Pressure Zone - supply pressure presses open the # 1 check and is minimized by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position.
