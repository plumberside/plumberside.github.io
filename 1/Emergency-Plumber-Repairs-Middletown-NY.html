<p>If your assembly stops working the yearly test, you are accountable for changing the assembly or repairing within thirty days.

<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when looking for a viable service, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are many disadvantages to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually consist of compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
