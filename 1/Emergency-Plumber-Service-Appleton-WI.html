In the ion exchange procedure, salt ions are utilized to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or artificial resin beads that resemble wet sand.</p>
<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this approach utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation site where hardness mineral ions are changed into a steady crystalline type that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation generally through the water. Unlike with a softener that uses ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not require ongoing regrowth.</p>
