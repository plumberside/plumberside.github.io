<p>A guideline is that you can recapture the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life expectancy. If, say, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself.
