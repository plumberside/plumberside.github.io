<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the wallet of a house owner. Plumbing Codes and State law dictate minimum requirements for backflow prevention. Public water supply such as the City Utilities Department need to satisfy or surpass the state requirements and bring the obligation for imposing them.</p>

It also saves you cash and time since a second inspection isn't essential.</p>
