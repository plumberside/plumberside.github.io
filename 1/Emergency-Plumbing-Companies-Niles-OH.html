<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend much more. With this approach, you know the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>If you've ever been irritated by cloudy white spots on your meals that won't go away, white shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll enjoy to understand that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Tough water causes these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to fret about any problems with mineral deposits staying. This makes chores simpler and less frustrating for everybody involved.</p>
