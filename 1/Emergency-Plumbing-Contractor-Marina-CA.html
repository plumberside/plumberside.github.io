Nevertheless, there are lots of downsides to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life.
