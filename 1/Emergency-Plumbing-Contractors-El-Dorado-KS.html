<h3>Quality Plumbing Service El Dorado KS</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal comes in 2 basic types - continuous feed, which typically has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which needs a food cover be in place to run the system. Continuous feed is common and the easiest to utilize; a batch feed design is safer but can be slower to utilize on big amounts of food waste because you have to process it in batches. An Ohio plumbing supply company supplies a summary of garbage disposal types and styles.</p>
<p>Depending upon the extent of the clog, we might use a range of different approaches, the most common being hydro-jetting. Hydro-jetting is an advanced type of drain cleaning where we utilize water under high pressure to completely clean out everything inside your drains. Lay the garbage disposal on its side and remove the electrical cover plate from the bottom. Loosen up the green ground screw and get rid of wire adapters. Disconnect waste disposal unit wires from electrical supply wires. Loosen up screws on the electrical clamp connector and remove wires from the garbage disposal.</p>
