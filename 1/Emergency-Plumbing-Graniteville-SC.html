<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws initially meant for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only consists of a waste arm, it is possible - though not advised - to link this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The consecutive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you might be able to cut off its elbow and use the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>

The repair may be as easy as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to understand what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
