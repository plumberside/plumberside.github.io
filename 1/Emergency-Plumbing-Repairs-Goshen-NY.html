<p>Many property owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their clogged or filthy drain issues. These chemicals are easy to use and low-cost, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are only short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize severe chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak spots that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always suggested.</p>
<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing components don't get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal includes two fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks quickly spin, and these bolts require food and particles to grind against a fixed grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action effectively crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
