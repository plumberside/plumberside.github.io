<p>A partial reroute is generally a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in particular neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
