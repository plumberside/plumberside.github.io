The hard water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are appliances that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. When the resin beads become full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service eliminates the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride service ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
