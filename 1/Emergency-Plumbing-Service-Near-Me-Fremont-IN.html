<p>No, you ought to NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're serious about safeguarding your drain and plumbing system. The reason is that these chemical cleaners can be even more harmful than helpful, possibly gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a home's entire plumbing system, including both supply of water and drain lines.
