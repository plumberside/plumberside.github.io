It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I selected this company due to the fact that they had terrific evaluations and a fair price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
