<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, but if your toilet is obstructing more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to examine. If your toilet is relatively brand-new, you may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a clog from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing details. Examine the list of state licensing firms to find out whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also maintains a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When an experienced tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
