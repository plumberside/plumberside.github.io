<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode a lot more quickly.
