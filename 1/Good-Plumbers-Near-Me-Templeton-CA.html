<p>When a gas line is ruptured, it immediately becomes a serious security threat. Without being fixed as rapidly as possible, it could cause a fair bit of damage if the natural gas inside ends up being sparked. If a person understands that they have ruptured a gas line, the first concern is to switch off the supply of gas and call the energy company.</p>
<p>One typical method for a home's water system to be contaminated is if the watering water lines, which could end up being polluted by pesticides or weed poison, backflow into the interior water lines.
