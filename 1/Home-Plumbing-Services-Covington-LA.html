<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and elaborate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a hard job. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working prior to they left. I am genuinely grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
