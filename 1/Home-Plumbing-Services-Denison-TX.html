<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to purchase a backflow valve if you see your water has an unusual circulation, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can determine whether the issue with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your house's plumbing system. More complex concerns with water temperature or pressure may require replacing the hot water heater, which typically costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capability and type.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to obtain this accreditation. I have actually checked with a few plumbers, and the prices quoted for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would expect the cost to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
