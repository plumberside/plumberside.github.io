<p>Inspect the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is easy and low-cost. However discovering the best washer might not be. The most common washers are typically readily available at home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be hard to find. Eliminate it and take it to the shop to find a match if you choose to hunt for a washer. Plumbers usually replace the entire fill valve rather than hunt for a replacement washer.</p>

The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information indicates for that particular assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
