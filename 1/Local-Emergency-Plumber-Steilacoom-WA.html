<p>Aside from these 2 important parts, there are a myriad of little, possibly less vital things that can break or degrade. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Continuous gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom.

<p>When to repair: Toilet clogs are not uncommon, but if your toilet is obstructing more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to examine. You might need to change toilet paper or work with a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is fairly brand-new. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing company where you can search for your state's licensing details. Inspect the list of state licensing agencies to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List likewise preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the device. Each place where you will have a gas appliance need to have a gas shutoff valve.
