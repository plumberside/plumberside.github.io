<p>Aside from these two important components, there are a myriad of little, possibly less critical things that can break or weaken. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust a lot more rapidly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting properly. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
