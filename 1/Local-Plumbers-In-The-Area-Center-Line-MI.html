<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the past if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather affordable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely delighted with their service.</p>
