<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to approach when searching for a feasible option, specifically when basic plunging doesn't seem to work.

These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is causing an obstruction, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, but at the cost of presenting the risk of damage to your home and household.</p>
