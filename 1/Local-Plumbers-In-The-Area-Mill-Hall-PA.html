<p>These guys were amazing! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been an issue on and off for many years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had excellent evaluations and a fair price, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a big, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it too.</p>
