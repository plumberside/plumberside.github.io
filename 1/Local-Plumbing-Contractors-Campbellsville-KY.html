<p>If the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a rule of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a brand-new burner package and the water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to spend the $120 for the part, particularly if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
