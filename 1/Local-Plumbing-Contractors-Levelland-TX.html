<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer warm water on demand without a tank. The activation of a faucet requiring hot water activates the heater and water is heated as it flows through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Cooking oil and other greases should never be put down the waste disposal unit since they can impede the blades.

A pump utilized to increase the water pressure within a structure's plumbing system to reach a higher floor might trigger this.
