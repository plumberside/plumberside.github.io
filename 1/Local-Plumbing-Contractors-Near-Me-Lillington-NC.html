<p>Natural gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is utilized for heating our houses, for lightening our ranges, and for running home appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas. Methane is a naturally happening gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also often formed by the decaying of organic matters like sewage or manure. As helpful as this gas is, the features that make this gas unsafe is its odorless and colorless nature, which makes it a quiet killer. However, to thwart off that danger, mercaptans are added into natural gas, which gives it a rotten egg smell and makes it detectable when leaking. Ensure to only trust an utmost professional with your gas line repair in Richmond.</p>
