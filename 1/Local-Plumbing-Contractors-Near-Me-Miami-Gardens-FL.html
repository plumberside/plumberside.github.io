Our makers run by snaking a rotating cable television with an attached blade through your pipes. The blades will dislodge the build-up due to grease, soap, tree roots, and other foreign items.

<p>Your waste disposal unit ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes two fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action successfully crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without clogging.</p>
