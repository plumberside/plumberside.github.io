<p>These people were amazing! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was installed 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable rate, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job tidying up after it as well.</p>
