<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that come from inside the home. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, likewise known as tree root invasion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to trigger drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already installed, such as cast iron, clay, plastic or copper, will figure out the degree of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>

<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into company wood further away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
