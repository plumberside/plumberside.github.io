<p>As the water treatment market has actually grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually often been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated advertising and, in part, to consumer mistaken beliefs about water treatment. However the reality is that water softening merely gets rid of firmness minerals and gets rid of problems that are an annoyance and not a threat to human health. The choice "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of individual choice not necessity. However, water softening does have advantages, and downsides, that make this decision a substantial one.</p>
