<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient throughout a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and remove water particles from the solution with solidity ions. The membrane has pores big enough to confess water molecules for passage; solidity ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is free of solidity ions without any other ions being added. Membranes are a type of water filter needing routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can happen.</p>
