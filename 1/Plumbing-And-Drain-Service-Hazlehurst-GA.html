<p>Backpressure is produced when pressure in a water system surpasses the pressure in the potable system offering the make-up water. This can force the drinkable water to reverse its direction of circulation through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The best method to minimize accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is specifically hard with high mineral material, you might need to flush the hot water heater more frequently.</p>
<p>Lots of toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not demand repairing the whole toilet. Like any home appliance, a toilet tank features many small moving parts that might need changed with usage over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leakages that aren't clearly visible to the naked eye. Toilet leakages around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
