Water pressure might be or fail minimized when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high need on the water supply (for example, when several fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe might permit polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
