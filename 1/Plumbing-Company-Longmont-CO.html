<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and detailed plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. Current Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were incredible. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Since of the age of the house and place of the pipe, it was a difficult job. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>

<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are replaced with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is total, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately switch to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 highlights both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
