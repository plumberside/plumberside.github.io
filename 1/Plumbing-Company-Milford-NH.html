<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Daddy's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task due to the fact that of the age of the house and location of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
