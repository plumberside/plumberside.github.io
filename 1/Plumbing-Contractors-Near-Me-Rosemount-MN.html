<p>As a locally-owned organisation, integrity and responsibility are incredibly important to constructing a credibility for excellence. Area 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of isolation backflow preventers (BFP) and Area 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses defense of the potable water system within a building these devices are referred to as isolation" BFP. Again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would stream over the rim of a sink or bathtub. The Warren County Plumbing Department checks to ensure there is an air space, if there is no other way to supply one, then we check to see that the correct BFP device is installed. These BFP's, if testable, are needed to be checked (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and a minimum of every twelve months afterwards.</p>

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without obstructing.</p>
