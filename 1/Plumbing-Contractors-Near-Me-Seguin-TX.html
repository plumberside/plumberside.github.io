<p>Echologics has a long history of developing award-winning acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from your home to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners may have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>The secret to preventing a clogged waste disposal unit is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there need to be no issue in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you need to most likely not take into the waste disposal unit though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another suggestion to stop obstructing is to look out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are finished cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
