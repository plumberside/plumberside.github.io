The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and hot tubs. Rotate the disposal system to line up the discharge tailpiece with the drain trap, and after that connect it. Relying on the existing trap configuration, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping beneath the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you might have the ability to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. Make sure it's changed appropriately (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
