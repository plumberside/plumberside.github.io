<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is usually the offender. However not always. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing securely. A chain with insufficient slack can trigger problem too. Photo 3 shows how to set the slack ideal.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. But more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey rate entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's obligation, not yours.</p>
