<p>Organic particles, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's cable television, snake or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup.

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
