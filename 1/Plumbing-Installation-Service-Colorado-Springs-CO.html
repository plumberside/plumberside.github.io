<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully listen and raise the rod. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed correctly (Photo 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>Some softeners deal with electrical energy, but some more current water softeners utilize waterpower. Expenses of a water softener greatly depend upon the type of water softener and the type of energy that is used, but also upon the solidity of the water that requires softening and the water use. When the water is really tough and it is utilized heavily, the expenses of softening will increase.</p>
