<p>When the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their elements. Some parts may have really tight tolerances that need to be preserved. A crucial thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the component. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each part. If the part is not repaired effectively, the guide could limit the motion (instead of direct or steady) of the component, which could cause the element to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are mistakenly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. Most of the times the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
