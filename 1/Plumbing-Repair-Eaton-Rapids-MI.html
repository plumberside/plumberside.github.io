<p>Whether you're a house owner, company owner, or residential or commercial property supervisor, at some time you will most likely need to call a plumber. It's a great idea to do a little research study into the world of plumbing before you call someone and turn them loose on your plumbing system. A good plumber can conserve your bacon. A bad plumber can be your worst problem in terms of issues that keep coming back to bite you.</p>
<p>Renovation plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Once again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
