It is essential that the repair professional knows the right installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly need to be set up in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is necessary that the assembly only be installed if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation may trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
