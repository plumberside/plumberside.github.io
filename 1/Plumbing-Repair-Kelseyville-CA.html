<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly focused solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
