<p>In some households, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to using these dangerous products - not least of which is that they generally include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the risk of harm to your home and household.</p>
