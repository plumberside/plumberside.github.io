<p>If your assembly fails the yearly test, you are responsible for repairing or replacing the assembly within one month.

<p>When a flush valve causes a toilet to run, a worn flapper is normally the offender. But not constantly. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper.

Image 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
