<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from your house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. House owners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for routine sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when selling or purchasing an older house.</p>
<p>As part of EBMUD's program, the District's backflow inspectors are needed to conduct site inspections to identify if a backflow prevention device is needed as a result of a actual or potential  cross-connection threat on a consumer's plumbing system. Plumbing and gas piping inspections found on Vashon Island are only carried out on Wednesdays. Area Repairs: Utilizing one or a combination of the above services, we will fix the problems we discover with the camera inspection straight without rooting out anymore than we need to.</p>
