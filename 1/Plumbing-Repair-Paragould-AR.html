It was set up 7 years ago, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair price, and even though the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a big, disgusting mess on their hands (literally), and they did an excellent task tidying up after it also.</p>
