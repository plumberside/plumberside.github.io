As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at an affordable quantity, there need to be no problem in getting most of the waste through. There are a few food products you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those products are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another pointer to stop obstructing is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will harden when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under hot water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are ended up cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
