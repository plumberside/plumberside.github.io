<p>The next requirements to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair service technician knows the correct installation orientation and can assess the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions circumventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, but it is essential that the assembly just be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work correctly and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work due to the fact that the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
