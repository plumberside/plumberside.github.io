<p>Template-Assisted Condensation: Reduced to TAC, this method utilizes resin beads as a catalytic nucleation website where solidity mineral ions are become a stable crystalline kind that will not cling to surfaces. These crystals are microscopic and circulation usually through the water. Unlike with a softener that utilizes ion-exchange, this tank of resin beads does not need ongoing regrowth.</p>
