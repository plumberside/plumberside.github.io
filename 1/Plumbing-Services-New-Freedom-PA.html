<p>Water hardness is the amount of liquified calcium and magnesium in the water-- tough water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Because soap responds with the calcium to form soap residue, the reason you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or cleaning agent to get things clean. Which's where the term firmness" came from ... it's difficult to clean in.</p>

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually contributed to the brine tank in the form of pellets or blocks. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is reducing, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
