Our repair procedures rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, flaws triggered by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from adhering to the walls properly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a comprehensive cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to permit the water to cover the whole diameter of the sewer line and supply a mindful cleaning.</p>
