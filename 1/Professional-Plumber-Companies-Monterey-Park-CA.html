<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and inspected and the rubber parts have actually been changed, now reassemble the parts back into their parts. Some parts may have very tight tolerances that have to be maintained. An essential thing to identify on each element is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a really crucial part of the style of each element. If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could limit the movement (instead of direct or consistent) of the part, which could cause the element to not work to its abilities.

In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is required.</p>
