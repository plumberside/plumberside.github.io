These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can range from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the risk of damage to your home and family.</p>
