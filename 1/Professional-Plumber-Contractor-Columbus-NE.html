Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos arrived at 8am the next day to repair. It was a challenging job because of the age of your home and location of the pipe. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to make sure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

<h3>Hour Emergency Plumbing Service Columbus NE</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
