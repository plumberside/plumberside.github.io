That's where the brine tank comes in. An on-board computer computes the quantity of water that flows through the softener. When it reaches the preprogrammed setting, regrowth instantly starts.

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates data on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
