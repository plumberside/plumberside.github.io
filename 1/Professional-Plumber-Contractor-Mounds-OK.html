<p>Replacing your sink is a step-by-step process. Step, cut, and link the pipes. Before connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. If you are utilizing copper pipes, solder on any nipples and fittings prior to connecting the system to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be used. Though it may require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far simpler to work with and can utilize push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>

This is why it is very important to call a plumber as quickly as you believe you have a leak or a broken tank part.
