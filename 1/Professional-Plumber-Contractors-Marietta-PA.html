Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they must be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another common area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
