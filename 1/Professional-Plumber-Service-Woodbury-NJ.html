<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, typically done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and pricey plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole home repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 year old Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and place of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
