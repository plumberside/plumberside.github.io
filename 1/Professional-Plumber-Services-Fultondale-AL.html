<p>Loose flanges are typically the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The best service depends on the level of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>If you have actually ever been frustrated by cloudy white areas on your dishes that will not disappear, white t-shirts that turn gray and dull after a couple of washes, or a stubborn layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll more than happy to understand that water softening can get rid of these problems and more. Difficult water triggers these problems due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash. With softened water, you will not need to worry about any problems with mineral deposits staying. This makes chores simpler and less annoying for everyone included.</p>
