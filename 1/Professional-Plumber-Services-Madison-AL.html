Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
