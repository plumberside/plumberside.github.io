<h3>The Importance Of Plumbers And Plumbing Services Waxahachie TX</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up designer (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP).

Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not present a danger to the water supply, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, along with a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
