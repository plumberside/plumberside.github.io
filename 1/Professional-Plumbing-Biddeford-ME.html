<p>In this scenario, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to purchase a backflow valve if you observe your water has an unusual circulation, taste, color or odor. A plumbing professional can determine whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the outcome of other problems in your home's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure might need changing the water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capacity and type.</p>
