<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on extremely gradually to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft hangars.

If a fire happens, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then allows water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
