<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

When the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system ought to be examined to make sure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close properly. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
