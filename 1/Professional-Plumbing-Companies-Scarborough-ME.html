<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
