<p>In this situation, unclean water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you notice your water has an unusual flow, color, odor or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your house's plumbing system.

The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The factor is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
