<p>Installation and replacement expenses are typically comparable, though replacement generally will not require surcharges, such as application charges. New meters should satisfy guidelines and code requirements for their placement, and gas suppliers might need an unique meter for their services, limiting your options. Design - Once you add a 2nd floor and even 3rd floor, pipes need to be run up to it. This is more complex than plumbing the ground floor and is more labor extensive. Plumbing services will utilize more products which contributes to your labor expenses.</p>
<p>Municipal - Hard water can trigger an absence of suds formation when soap is agitated in water and cause the development of lime scale in hot water heater. Your water is red or brown.
