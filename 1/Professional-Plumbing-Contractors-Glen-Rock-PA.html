<p>Drain obstructions in bathroom sinks can happen in time from the accumulation of hair, little bits of soap and fibers from towels that builds up within pipes. As a clog becomes bigger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining properly.

<p>Numerous house owners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to fix their clogged or unclean drain problems. These chemicals are simple to utilize and inexpensive, but they damage your pipes and their effects are just short term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners use severe chemicals to eat away at the clog and with duplicated use, these chemicals will also gnaw at the pipe developing weak spots that are susceptible to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always recommended.</p>
<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they usually include compounds such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a clog, which can range from the normal suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of presenting the threat of harm to your house and family.</p>
