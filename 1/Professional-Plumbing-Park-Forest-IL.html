Leaks can likewise take place if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from taking place, install the system in a steady and safe location. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the foundation begins moving, the softener doesn't fall over and rip out the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait until after the cycle is completed and after that checked the system for fractures or broken fittings.
