<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Sick Of False Assures? Water flows in the tank where small resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is described as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Because it can spread out contaminated water back through a circulation system, Backflow is a prospective problem in a water system. For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or real connection between the public water system and a source of contamination or pollution) can permit pollutants or toxins to go into the safe and clean water supply. Illness can result from ingesting water that has actually been contaminated due to backflow.</p>
<p>Clearly the resin is not a limitless exchange site. When all the salt exchange sites are changed with firmness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be run on an alternate cycle called regeneration. During this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had been adsorbed on the resin. As soon as backwashing is complete, the softener can be returned to utilize. Some water softeners will immediately change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 illustrates both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
