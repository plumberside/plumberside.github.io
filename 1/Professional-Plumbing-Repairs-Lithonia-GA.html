Once again, the best type of backflow prevention is an air space, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

These BFP's, if testable, are required to be evaluated (by a certified backflow preventer tester) upon installation and at least every twelve months thereafter.</p>
