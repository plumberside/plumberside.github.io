<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step process. Measure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before connecting the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far much easier to deal with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, saving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
<p>Backflow prevention assemblies are developed to supply decades of protection. There are many local conditions that can reduce the working life of a backflow preventer.  Conditions such as extreme pressure, water quality, turbidity or temperature level can all trigger the assembly to degrade in its efficiency. Some backflow prevention assemblies might hardly ever need repair while some are repaired regularly. The test data from the field test will figure out the repair frequency.</p>

The backflow prevention assembly need to be disassembled and parts changed with original factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be tested once again to be sure it was correctly repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the makers flow diagram is necessary to guarantee it was repaired correctly. A properly repaired assembly needs to supply years of security.</p>
