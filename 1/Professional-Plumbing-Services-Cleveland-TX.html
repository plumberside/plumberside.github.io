<p>When the drinkable supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may take place. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in places such as high-rise buildings or tanks. Safe and clean and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the drinkable supply system if these connections are not appropriately protected.</p>
<p>The backflow preventer is a device that prevents impurities or pollutants from being drawn into the drinking water system.

<p>In the meantime, however, we suggest you first try using non-abrasive and non-harsh white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Just pour a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mixture sit for a while. If that does not work, you can attempt a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner. A number of these cleaners include focused levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be very hazardous if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If using one of these products, please make sure to take the appropriate preventative measures.</p>
