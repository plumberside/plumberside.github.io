<h3>Copper Pipe Repair in Springville Alabama</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved difficult water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals.
