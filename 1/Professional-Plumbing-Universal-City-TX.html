<p>A backflow preventer is a method or system to prevent backflow. The standard means of avoiding backflow is an air gap, which either removes a cross-connection or offers a barrier to backflow.

The principal types of mechanical backflow preventers are the reduced-pressure concept assembly, the pressure vacuum breaker assembly, and the check valve assembly.</p>
