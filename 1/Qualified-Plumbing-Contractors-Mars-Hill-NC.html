<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable reversal of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
