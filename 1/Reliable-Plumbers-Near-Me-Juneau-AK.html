<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had constantly leaked in the past. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was quite reasonable. I will certainly use them for any future plumbing needs. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
