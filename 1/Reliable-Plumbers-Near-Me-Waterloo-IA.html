<p>E.R. Services understands the value of keeping the stability and efficiency of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a positive charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners use to replace firmness ions, also has a positive charge, so none of these ions are attracted to each other. Nevertheless, salt's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't attracted to each other, how can an exchange happen? There is one other essential aspect needed to make the process work: a resin bed consisting of great deals of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>

<p>Some makers declare that the electrical gadgets they produce can impact the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surfaces. Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream impacts that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has actually shown a decrease of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
