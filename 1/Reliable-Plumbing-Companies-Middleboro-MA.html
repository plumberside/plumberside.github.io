I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.

<p>Jamming or Clogged: For the many part, a garbage disposal is just equipped to deal with softer natural waste.

<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain due to the fact that they usually contain grease and fat. When the fat of the soap combines with mineral water, it sticks and forms a solid residue to the pipes, obstructing them.
