<h3>Know The Work Of The Commercial Plumber Ottawa KS</h3>

It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had terrific reviews and a fair cost, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a terrific job cleaning up after it too.</p>
