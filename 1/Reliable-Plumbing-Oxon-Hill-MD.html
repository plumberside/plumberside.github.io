<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
