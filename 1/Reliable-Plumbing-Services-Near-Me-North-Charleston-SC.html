<p>Water temperature problems can be fixed by changing the temperature on the water heater. Low water pressure from a sink faucet might be triggered by a blocked aerator screen.

If you are experiencing a leak originating from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make sure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. Try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>

But while small drips should not be cause for concern, property owners ought to keep an eye on the water heater leakages. I had a fantastic experience with Gotelli Plumbing when we needed a leak in a pipe repaired. Tom was friendly and professional. He also did the job faster than original approximated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing once again in the future.</p>
