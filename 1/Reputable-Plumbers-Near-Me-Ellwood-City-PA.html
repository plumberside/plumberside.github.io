<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing acclaimed acoustic innovations for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a video camera through the household sewer pipes (normally from the house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be utilized to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, deterioration or collapsed pipes. Homeowners might have a video inspection done to find the reason for regular sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older home.</p>
<p>We have 2 no-dig techniques to repair your sewer line: CIPP and pipe bursting. We complete CIPP repairs with no excavation. Pipe breaking requires minimal digging.
