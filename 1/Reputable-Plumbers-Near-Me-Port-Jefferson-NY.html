<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Put simply, soft water saves you cash. Minimized Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that includes two separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Any time the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire protection systems, they do have a flaw: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing totally, backflow can happen.</p>
