<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc The majority of the houses in our area were developed prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for cold and hot water became basic. Older homes were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that can be found in contact with water and oxygen will wear away. This rust, or rust, causes the iron to swell up and become flaky. In order to avoid the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to protect the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>You may be lured to bond or spot a leak shut or replace just a single area of pipe to conserve money. While this might work in the short term, remember that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, implying that problem could be brewing somewhere else in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you assurance and avoid larger leaks down the roadway.</p>
