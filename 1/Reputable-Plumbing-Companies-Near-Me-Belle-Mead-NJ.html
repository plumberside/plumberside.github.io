<p>To determine if your house is a poly house," start with the outside. Underground water mains are normally blue in color (they can also be gray or black). The pipe is typically 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main turned off is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
