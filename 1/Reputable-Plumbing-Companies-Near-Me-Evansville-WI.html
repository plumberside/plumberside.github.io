<p>Wondering how much do plumbers credit snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a great deal of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers generally charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or slowly draining pipes. While a garbage disposal is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a garbage disposal, leading to obstructions.
