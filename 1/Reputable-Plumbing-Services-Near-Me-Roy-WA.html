<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, and so on.
