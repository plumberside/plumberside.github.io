<p>The pipe-bursting approach is used on pipes that are severely harmed, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for fixing larger sections of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, that includes 2 4 foot square access pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by positioning a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is utilized to drag the head through the pipe.
