<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the tough water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water brings contaminants back to the main water system system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
