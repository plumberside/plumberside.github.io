If the part is not fixed effectively, the guide could restrict the movement (instead of direct or stable) of the component, which could trigger the component to not work to its abilities. Lot of times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the component causing lower test outcomes than what is needed.</p>
