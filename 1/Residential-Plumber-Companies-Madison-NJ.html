The repair might be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data indicates for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
