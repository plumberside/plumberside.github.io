<p>Check Valve (DCV) - safe for usage both inside and underground, DCVs are a little more costly but are also extremely convenient, as they can be set up horizontally or vertically. Video cameras are useful in locating buried septic systems or checking the condition of buried pipes to identify appropriate maintenance schedules or the level of needed repairs. When the corrupt salesperson takes control of the camera, he may play a pre-taped inspection of a pipe in very bad condition and state it is your pipe.</p>
