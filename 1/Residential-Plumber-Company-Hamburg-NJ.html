It might be regular to have condensation on hot water pipes, but it's definitely not regular for your pipes to spring a leak.</p>
<p>Carefully listen and raise the rod if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You might be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no adjustment screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's adjusted effectively (Picture 8). You do not need to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
<p>If the hot water heater is leaking from the bottom of the tank, that is a sign the tank is failing and will need to be changed. Schedule an estimate as quickly as possible and ensure nothing is near the heater that could be potentially damaged if it is in a garage and a little slow leak. Leaking hot water heater can burst triggering water damage and flooding of houses.</p>
