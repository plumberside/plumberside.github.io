The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Frequently, it goes into the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to completion of the water main. Make certain you inspect both ends of the pipe. We have actually found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
