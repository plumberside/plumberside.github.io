Gene Johnson Plumbing & Heating has service technicians thoroughly trained to discover the location of the leak, and either repair or replace the pipe, depending on the seriousness of the leak. Prior to working with any pro, make sure to request for totally free estimates on just how much it will cost to fix your plumbing problems.
