<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where tiny resin beads swap the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regrowth). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
