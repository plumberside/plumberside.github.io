There are two kinds of waste disposal unit, a continuous feed or a batch feed. The typical cost of a continuous-feed disposal runs at $216, while the typical batch feed disposal costs $335.</p>
<p>Sinks aren't as simple as they used to be. These days, homeowners can pick from an excessive series of sinks for the kitchen, bath, damp bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink.

If your house was developed prior to the 1970s, we highly encourage that you employ a plumbing professional to inspect your house's plumbing and check if there are areas that need repiping.
