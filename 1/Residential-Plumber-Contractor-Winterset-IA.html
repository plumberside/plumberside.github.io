<p>With tankless electric heaters, water is heated up directly whenever it's required. When the tap is changed on, tankless systems particularly make usage of a component that warms up water. The water is constantly heated up as long as the tap remains on. If the tap is immediately turned off, the water stops being heated up. The heating temperature is usually pre-set to match your needs and preferences. Due to the fact that they only heat water when needed, tankless electrical water heaters use less power than standard water heaters.</p>
