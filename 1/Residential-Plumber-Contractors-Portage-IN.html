We use cutting-edge approaches and tools, like cable devices, to eliminate even the most persistent roots and clogs.

<p>A cross-connection is any permanent or short-term connection between a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean (i.e., drinking) water system and any source or system containing nonpotable water or other compounds.

<p>Your garbage disposal makes sure that your sink and plumbing fixtures do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's perception, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Instead, a waste disposal unit features two stationary bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk. When the disposal is turned on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and particles to grind against a fixed mill along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can take a trip down the drain without blocking.</p>
