Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
