<p>There are numerous causes for clogs depending on where they take place in your plumbing Toilets clog from excessive toilet tissue for the a lot of part. When the bathroom tissue collects in the sewer pipe leading from the toilet rather of flowing through it, the toilet will not flush. The water only back up in the bowl.

You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
