Given that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like traditional water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the elimination of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant growth promo have actually been declared, such systems do not eliminate minerals from the water itself.

With well water, these signs might likewise be coupled with iron spots and sulfur-smells coming from the tap.</p>
