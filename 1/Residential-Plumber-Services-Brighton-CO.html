<p>Backflow suggests the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from taking place. Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly created and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public supply of water.</p>
