<p>A reduced pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is actually a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is since if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an additional layer of defense compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make certain the RPZ discharges.</p>
