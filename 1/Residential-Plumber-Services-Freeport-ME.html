<h3>Clogged Sewer Line in Freeport Maine</h2>
<p>A rule of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair if the problems happens well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span. If, say, you need a brand-new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years old, then it makes good sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limitation, the more doubtful the economics of a repair becomes. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>
