Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't impact the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom.
