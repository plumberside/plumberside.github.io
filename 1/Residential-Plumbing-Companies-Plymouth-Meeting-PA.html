<p>The toilet tank fills with water after being flushed. The pipe is insulated according to code to prevent winter freezing. The new pipe, made from a high-tech, crosslinked polyethylene, is fed down through the walls. Some drywall and wall product are removed to connect the pipes to the water components, Wood says. Depending on the scope of work being performed and the kind of structure, you may have one or more inspections.</p>
<p>Carefully raise the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Picture 8). You do not have to clear the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

Difficult water triggers these issues due to the minerals in the water that are left after a wash.
