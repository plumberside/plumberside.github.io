<p>Organic debris, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a novice's DIY job. If you utilize the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
