Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. Therefore when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you presume a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: spray a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has altered color. You most likely have a leak if it has.</p>
