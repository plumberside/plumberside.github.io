<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will establish. Often the option is to repair the broken section of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is necessary to resolve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive option is required: repiping.</p>
<p>The individual who does the testing needs to be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to acquire this accreditation. I have actually contacted a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would expect the price to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
