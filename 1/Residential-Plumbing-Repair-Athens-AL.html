<p>Agilent's variety of leak detection solutions ensure the security, security and consistent efficiency of research, vacuum, and commercial procedure systems. Inspecting the water meter is a great next action in your plumbing inspection. Close all faucets and inspect if the water meter is turning. If it is, there is a leak somewhere and this might be major issue. Proceed to the valves. Start with the main shut off valve operation. When shut off, no faucet in your house must have water. This goes for every other turned off valve and their matching faucets. You are off to a great start if everything is working appropriately.</p>

<p>When the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water supply, backpressure backflow in a structure results. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature increases in boilers, or if there is a reduction in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
