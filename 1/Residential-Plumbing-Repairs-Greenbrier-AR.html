For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more quickly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you might need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. Tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>
