<p>It is not always due to obstructions that come from inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to become clogged due to tree roots, also referred to as tree root invasion.

<p>One common way for a home's supply of water to be infected is if the watering water lines, which could become polluted by pesticides or weed toxin, backflow into the interior water lines. If that polluted water were to backflow into the neighborhood drinking supply, the problem could spread out tremendously. A backflow preventer not only secures drinking water in private homes, it also prevents wastewater in private homes from flowing back out and polluting the general public water system.</p>
<p>A variety of companies, such as the American Water Works Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) use accreditation courses designed to train experts to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires knowledge of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to become certified.</p>
