<p>Whether a water supply is labelled "soft" or "hard" depends on the existence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no unfavorable effects and are, in truth, vital day-to-day nutrients. It is minerals that give water the refreshing flavor many people find preferable. Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium permeate water, they accumulation on contact surfaces, perhaps plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and reduce the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>
<p>Your home's drainage works by the simple force of gravity. When you flush water and waste down your sink or shower (and your toilets too) it's not truly the circulation of water pushing them down your pipes. Rather, once they go down your drain, gravity takes over as the pipes under the ground are pitched at a down angle to the sewer line. When something obstructs the pipes, anything you put down there will not go through.</p>
