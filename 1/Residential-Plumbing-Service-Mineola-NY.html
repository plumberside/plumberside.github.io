<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as assured. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These rates are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The overall you pay may be higher if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, carefully lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts down, you may be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no modification screw, flex the float arm. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, make certain it's adjusted properly (Image 8). You do not need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>

A lot of sink clogs that occur are much deeper than you may think, and the seriousness is so severe that a common store-bought drain cleaner or unscripted home drain cleaning solution can not fix.</p>
