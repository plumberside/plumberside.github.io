<p>These men were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had fantastic evaluations and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it as well.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very delighted with their service.</p>
