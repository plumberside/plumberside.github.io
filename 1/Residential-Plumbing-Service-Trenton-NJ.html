<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a great guy. He told me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as promised. I will definitely use Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices are in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
<p>Numerous homeowners will use a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to solve their clogged or dirty drain problems.

This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is constantly recommended.</p>
