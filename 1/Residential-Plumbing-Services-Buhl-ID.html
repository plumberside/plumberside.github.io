<p>If your assembly fails the yearly test, you are responsible for replacing the assembly or fixing within thirty days. All replacements must be set up to Manatee County Utilities Standards and be the right type of assembly based on the conditions on your property (see section listed below "Needed Backflow Prevention Assemblies") Additionally, the assembly needs to meet the lead free requirement of Area 1417 of the Safe Drinking Water Act (42 U.S.C. 300g-6) If you are still out of compliance after the thirty days, all water services will be discontinued until the assembly is in compliance.</p>
<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you suspect a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, attempt this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, check to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually changed color. If it has, you most likely have a leak.</p>
