It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company due to the fact that they had great evaluations and a reasonable rate, and although the task took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
