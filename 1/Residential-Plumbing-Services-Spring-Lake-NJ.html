Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm.

These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is causing a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where broken pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, but at the cost of providing the danger of harm to your home and household.</p>
