<p>When it concerns repairing a broken or stopping working sewer line, there are a few alternatives. The best choice for your house will depend on a couple of elements, consisting of the age of your existing pipes, the level of damage, and your spending plan. An authorized backflow prevention device, which need to be checked annually, should be installed on the service connection that the department has actually recognized as having a capacity for backflow.</p>
<p>Light Blue = Reduced Pressure Zone - supply pressure pushes open the # 1 check and is decreased by the # 1 Check spring (for example, to 90 psi). This pressure difference across the # 1 check valve preserves the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse movement of fluid).</p>

Such connections occur naturally in home appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and set up to avoid backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
