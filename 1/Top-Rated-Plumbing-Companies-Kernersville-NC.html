<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the safe and clean supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
