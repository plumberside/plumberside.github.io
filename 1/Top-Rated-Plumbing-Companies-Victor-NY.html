<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and a great man. He informed me exactly what to expect (cost, time, procedure) in advance and provided as assured. I will definitely use Clog Dawg again. Setting up a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal system. If your plumber has a minimum callout cost that is greater than the labor cost for the work, the total you pay might be greater.</p>
