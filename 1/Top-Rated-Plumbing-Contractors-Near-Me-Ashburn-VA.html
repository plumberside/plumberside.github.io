<p>Backpressure is developed when pressure in a water system exceeds the pressure in the safe and clean system providing the cosmetics water. This can force the safe and clean water to reverse its direction of flow through the cross-connection in between the two systems. Potential pollutants can then go into the drinkable water supply. The very best way to decrease accumulation is have a professional flush it at least as soon as a year. In some areas of Virginia, where the water is especially difficult with high mineral material, you may need to flush the water heater regularly.</p>
