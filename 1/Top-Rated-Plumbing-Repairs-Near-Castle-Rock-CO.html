<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the basic structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a common reason for polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
