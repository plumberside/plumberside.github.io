A backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve plan developed to prevent the turnaround of the flow of water once it has actually passed through the valve. The two types of pipes that we choose to use for repiping are copper and PEX. These are 2 really different materials, however they both have unbelievable toughness and durability.</p>
