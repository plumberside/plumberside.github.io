<p>Often, an inexperienced person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as basic as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's duty to understand what the field test data implies for that particular assembly.  When an experienced tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
