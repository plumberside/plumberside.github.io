<p>Backflow is bad news. The extreme water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on pipes. Over a time period the inside lining of the pipe will weaken and a small pinhole leak will develop. Often the solution is to repair the broken area of pipe, and a spot repair is all that is required to resolve the concern. Other times a more comprehensive service is needed: repiping.</p>
<p>No warm water-- The lack of hot water is the most significant sign that there is something incorrect with your San Antonio hot water heater. If you aren't getting enough hot water for your shower, then you may have sediment that has actually developed in the system and separated the water from the heat source. It's time to seek advice from the specialists if your water heater isn't doing its only job.</p>
