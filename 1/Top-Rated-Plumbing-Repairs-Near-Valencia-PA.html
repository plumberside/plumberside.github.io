<p>Button Plumbing was fantastic. They changed my kitchen faucet and included two brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had always dripped in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly happy with their service.</p>

<p>A. Typically wax does not "spoil" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undetected issue. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
