<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Hellertown PA 18055</h3>
<p>It is not constantly due to blockages that stem inside the home when drains are clogged. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, also known as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside somebody's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, plastic, clay or copper, will determine the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
