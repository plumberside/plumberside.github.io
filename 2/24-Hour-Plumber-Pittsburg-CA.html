<p>Then attach the drain (and dishwasher hose, if suitable). If your unit is outlet-ready-- take note of this part-- make certain your disposal switch remains in the off" position before you plug the new system in.

<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. If I shut off the water under the sink, they replaced my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous. I mentioned that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite sensible. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing requirements. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>
