<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less easily when water is hard. Water softening can prevent these unfavorable results. Natural gas is a colorless, odor-free fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell frequently related to rotten eggs. This unique scent allows you to smell a potential leak if it takes place. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>

Sodium will not cause lime scale or soap residue accumulation like other minerals do, and water softening includes only a very percentage of salt to your water.
