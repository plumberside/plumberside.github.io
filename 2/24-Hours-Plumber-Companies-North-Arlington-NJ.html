<h3>Residential Plumbing Emergencies North Arlington NJ</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>When jiggling the handle doesn't suffice, it's time to call Apollo for toilet repair or replacement. We will install new toilets and replace existing toilets.
