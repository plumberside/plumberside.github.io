<p>If the problems occurs well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can regain the cost of the repair. If, say, you need a brand-new burner kit and the water heater is five years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, especially if you can do the work yourself. The closer the device is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more skeptical the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the device will go or its tank will leak. And there's no cure for a leaking tank.</p>

<p>These people were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had fantastic reviews and a fair cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters.
