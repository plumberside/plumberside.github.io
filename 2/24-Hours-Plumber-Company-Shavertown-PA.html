<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly vulnerable to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. They harden to the piping walls if fats are put down the sink.

If this is what is happening to your house, you need your drain cleaned prior to it causes further damage and even more expensive repairs.</p>
