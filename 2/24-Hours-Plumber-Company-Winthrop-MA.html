Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day costs and disappointments sustained by tough water, a water softener is eventually a financial investment that will save you a significant amount of money. The cost of the water softener system is considerably outweighed by the cash and energy saved.</p>
<p>You may be tempted to weld or patch a leak shut or replace only a single section of pipe to save cash. While this may work in the short-term, bear in mind that the weakened pipe is made from the same product as other pipes in your home, indicating that problem might be brewing elsewhere in your plumbing system. Repiping now will provide you peace of mind and avoid larger leakages down the road.</p>
