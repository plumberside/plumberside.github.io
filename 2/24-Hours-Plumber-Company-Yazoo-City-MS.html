Mineral deposits can choose the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be heated and readily available for use. Likewise, deterioration of the tank's components can cause the tank to have a short life. If the hot water heater is old or you see apparent indications of rust, request that a brand-new one be set up.</p>

If the drains clog periodically however you can normally flush them out, this might be a smaller sized clog like a buildup of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap residue from the bathroom. Small blockages can develop into big ones relatively rapidly.</p>
