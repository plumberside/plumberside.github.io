<h3>What Services Do Plumbers Provide Carterville IL</h3>
<p>The most effective way to deal with hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>This is incredibly important! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet offers to push the waste out of your drain system. Present regulations limit the amount of water a toilet can use per flush to 1.28 gallons per flush which can leave particles accumulating in cast iron drain lines. We offer 2 kinds of water treatment systems for hard water: Advantage Series Seawater Softeners and NaturSoft Â® Water Softener Alternatives.</p>
