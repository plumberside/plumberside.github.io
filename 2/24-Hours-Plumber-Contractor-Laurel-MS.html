<p>Versus this, there is some anecdotal evidence that particular magnetic and electro-magnetic gadgets can be efficient in preventing scale formation in hard water systems. It is extremely difficult to evaluate such claims, which are nearly never ever based upon tests that are well sufficient explained to enable others to examine them and to validate the results.

<p>Backflow indicates the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water system gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
<p>Requirements in NFPA 13: Standard for the Installation of Sprinkler Systems for installing backflow preventers and in NFPA 25: Standard for the Inspection, Testing and Maintenance of Water-Based Fire Security Systems for performing annual forward circulation tests are in some cases perceived as a required to have them. But the intent of the code is to just attach installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>

<p>According to the Environmental Protection Agency, cross-connections can be a major public health hazard if they do not have adequate backflow prevention assemblies installed. There are various, well-documented cases in which cross-connections have actually been responsible for contamination of drinking water that, when consumed, caused the spread of illness or disease.</p>
