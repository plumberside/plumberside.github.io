<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can build up in cost really quickly.
