Since these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like conventional water softeners do, one benefit claimed for the user is the removal of the need to include salt to the system. While particle size decrease and plant development promotion have been claimed, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have.

Which is why selecting a comfortable, well-made toilet seat is incredibly crucial. However, you need to ensure your toilet seat actually fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat suffices for safety and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too big or much to small, unless they have been specifically developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to slide around, or won't disperse your weight evenly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
