<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or gas is extremely low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is a remarkably pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Letters are sent out to residential customers with recognized backflow gadgets on an annual basis. The City's plumbing code requires a backflow preventer on all landscape watering systems, swimming pools, and jacuzzis.

Relying on the existing trap setup, you might need to replace some or all of the drain piping below the sink to accommodate the disposal.</p>
