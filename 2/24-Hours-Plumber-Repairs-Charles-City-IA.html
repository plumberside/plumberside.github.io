<p>Clark's Process: This process is likewise called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so co2 need to be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down.

<p>Almost all softeners fall into one of 2 classifications. Timed models have programmable timeclocks that will regenerate on an established schedule and then return to service. Due to the fact that they regenerate whether the resin requires it or not, these work well for families that are on routine water-using cycles but will squander more water and salt. Demand-control designs, with either electrical and mechanical sensors, typically regenerate after numerous gallons of water have actually been softened. If you have a fluctuating water use schedule, such models are practical.</p>
