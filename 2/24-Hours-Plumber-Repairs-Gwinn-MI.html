When the test results reveal the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair process. It is necessary that the plumbing system be turned on really gradually to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system.

Once the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are entirely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
