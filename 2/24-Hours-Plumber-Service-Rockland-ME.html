Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public supply of water react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and become brittle. This results in micro-fractures and decreases the fundamental structural stability of the system.

<h3>Hot Water Heater Repair in Rockland Maine</h2>
<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is swapped for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
