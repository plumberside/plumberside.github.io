<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from your house to its connection to the general public sewer system) can be used to examine the type and condition of underground pipes, and to identify problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, blockages, rust or collapsed pipes. Property owners might have a video inspection done to discover the reason for periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
