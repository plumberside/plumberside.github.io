<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code protects the general public water system and personal on-site supply of water and circulation systems by prohibiting cross-connections between potable (ideal for drinking) and non-potable water systems, and by requiring installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention techniques. Secondary backflow methods offer an increased level of defense for the public water system system.</p>
<p>With tankless electrical heaters, water is warmed directly whenever it's required. Tankless systems particularly use a component that heats up water when the tap is turned on. The water is constantly warmed as long as the tap stays on. If the tap is immediately switched off, the water stops being heated. The heating temperature level is usually pre-set to suit your needs and preferences. Due to the fact that they just heat water when required, tankless electric water heaters use less power than conventional water heaters.</p>
