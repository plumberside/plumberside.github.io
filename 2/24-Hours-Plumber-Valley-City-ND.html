<p>Plumbers repair and install water, gas, and other piping systems in services, factories, and homes. They install plumbing components, such as bath tubs and toilets, and home appliances, such as dishwashers and hot water heater. They clean drains, get rid of blockages, and repair or replace broken pipes and fixtures. Plumbers also help preserve septic systems-- large, underground holding tanks that collect waste from houses that are not linked to a sewer system.</p>
<p>Tough water triggers a higher threat of lime scale deposits in household water systems. Due to this lime scale build-up, pipes are blocked and the performance of hot boilers and tanks is reduced. This increases the cost of domestic water heating by about fifteen to twenty percent.
