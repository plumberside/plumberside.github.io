Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water supply pressure occur whenever the amount of water being utilized goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
