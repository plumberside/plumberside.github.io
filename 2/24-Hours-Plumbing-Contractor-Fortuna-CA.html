<p>Anode Rod Failure: This metal rod is usually made from aluminum or magnesium and remains as a point of contact with the water in your tank. This is so that it can draw in the irons that would normally cause rust. After extended use, these rods will ultimately end up being worn out and need to be replaced.

<p>Lots of homeowners will utilize a store-bought chemical drain cleaner to resolve their dirty or clogged drain issues. These chemicals are simple to use and low-cost, however they damage your pipes and their impacts are just short-term. Store-bought liquid drain cleaners utilize harsh chemicals to gnaw at the clog and with repeated usage, these chemicals will also eat away at the pipe producing weak spots that are vulnerable to burst. This is why professional drain cleaning from a drain cleaning company is always advised.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool producer Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately 2 hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
