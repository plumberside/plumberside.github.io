<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's potable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the potable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can produce boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
