<p>The proper repair of a backflow preventer requires lots of items to be evaluated. The hydraulic conditions present at the backflow prevention assembly need to be assessed. The installation must be assessed to guarantee it does not circumvent the operations of the assembly. Test data need to be built up to figure out the operations of each part. The backflow prevention assembly must be dismantled and parts replaced with initial factory parts. The backflow prevention assembly must be evaluated again to be sure it was appropriately repaired. Comparing the test results from the fixed backflow prevention assembly to the producers flow chart is needed to guarantee it was repaired correctly. An effectively repaired assembly needs to supply years of defense.</p>

<p>A. Normally wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to avoid smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undetected problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
