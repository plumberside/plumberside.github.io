<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and costly plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger an obstruction or can trigger corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Over time sediment can build up in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the noise.</p>
