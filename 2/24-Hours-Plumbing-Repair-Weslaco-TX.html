<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leaks under the sink to confirm that your plumber's putty is making an excellent seal. Get rid of the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leaks and tighten up as needed. Plug unit into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and organize cables as wanted.</p>
<p>Use of tankless systems in second homes removes risks of water damage. Conventional hot water tanks have danger of leaking, which can cause pricey damage repairs, especially when left unattended.
