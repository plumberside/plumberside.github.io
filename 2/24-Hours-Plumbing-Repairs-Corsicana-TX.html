<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive inventory of backflow valves and related devices consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the general public water supply respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without warning, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to detect.</p>
