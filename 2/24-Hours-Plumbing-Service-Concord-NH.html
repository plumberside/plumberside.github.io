Making use of these items is called chemigation. There are several elements to this valve. The check valve has a spring operated flapper, which permits circulation in just one direction.

He also finished the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was more economical than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
