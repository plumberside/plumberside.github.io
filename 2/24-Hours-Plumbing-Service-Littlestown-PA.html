<h3>Warning Signs of Sewer Mainline Pipe Clogs in Littlestown PA 17340</h3>
<p>Strange Sounds - If uncommon gurgling is originating from your drain, it probably needs an extensive cleaning. When food or waste clog your drains, it makes it challenging for the water to pass through. The pipes typically make odd gurgling sounds as water attempts to pass through a clogged pipe due to the fact that of the tight space. This causes the water to bubble, as just small pockets of air are available, leading to the weird sounds originating from your sink.</p>
