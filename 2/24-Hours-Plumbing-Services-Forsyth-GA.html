<p>Kcb plumbing contractors, Inc Most of the houses in our area were built prior to 1965, which is the time when copper piping for hot and cold water became basic. Older houses were installed with galvanized iron cut and thread pipe. Iron that comes in contact with water and oxygen will corrode. This corrosion, or rust, causes the iron to inflate and become flaky. In order to prevent the rusting of the iron, the pipes were dipped in zinc. The zinc bonds with the iron and creates a waterproof membrane to secure the iron from rusting.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is normally funnelled somewhere else to a close-by treatment plant, a creek, or perhaps the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be vulnerable to clogging since there just isn't enough a high sufficient flow to eliminate the particles.</p>
