<h3>Benefits Of Commercial Plumbing Services Anchorage AK</h3>

A licensed professional can help you figure out if your structure needs a backflow preventer or numerous devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very uncommon cases where the structure is deemed to not position a threat to the supply of water, need to be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, however the DEP has no record of its installation, you should have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP review.</p>
