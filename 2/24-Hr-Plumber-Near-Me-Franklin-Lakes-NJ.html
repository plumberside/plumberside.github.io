<p>The source or place of a sewer issue determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the general public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (typically 10 feet wide) where main sewers pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Your waste disposal unit makes sure that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not contain blades. Rather, a waste disposal unit includes 2 fixed bolts that are fixed to a spinning disk. When the disposal is switched on the disks rapidly spin, and these bolts force food and debris to grind against a stationary grinder along the periphery of the spinning disk. This high-speed action efficiently crushes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without clogging.</p>
