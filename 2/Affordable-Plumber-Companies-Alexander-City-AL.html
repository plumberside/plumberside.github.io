<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your home, that makes its plumbing's effective functioning a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is very important that the plumbing system be switched on very slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. As soon as the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system need to be checked to ensure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close properly. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
