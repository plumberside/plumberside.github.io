<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of one or more afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
