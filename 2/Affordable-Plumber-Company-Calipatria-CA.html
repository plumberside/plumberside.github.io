The research study included tests that removed hard soils, in addition to examining recording and identifying. Researchers discovered that softened water utilizes almost 30% less detergent, but cleans along with water at 10 gpg solidity level. That cleaning agent cost savings increases to almost 70% when comparing soft water with water at a 25 gpg level.</p>
