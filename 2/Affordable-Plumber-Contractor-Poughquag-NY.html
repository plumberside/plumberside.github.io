<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can happen over time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog becomes larger in time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining correctly. You can fight hard water in various ways, including filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, including a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
<p>The Delaware Department of Public Health Plumbing Authorization and Inspection Program has offices in Kent and Sussex Counties. For example, a water-main break or the opening of a fire hydrant can cause water pipes to lose pressure. When that happens, water is no longer pressed forward into the property, allowing it to flow backwards into city water materials.</p>

Requirements for training differ by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers needs understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
