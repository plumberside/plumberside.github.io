<p>It can clog pipes and soap will dissolve in it less quickly when water is hard. Water softening can avoid these unfavorable impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a security preventative measure, we include a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically associated with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinct scent allows you to smell a potential leak. If you presume a leak, always leave.</p>
<p>Storm drains are an integral part in an advanced system that has actually been designed and crafted to take all of the floodwaters and run from rainstorms and channel it safely into the cities drainage systems. Without storm drains we 'd have to deal with flooded locations often throughout bouts of severe rain.
