<h3>Need An Emergency Plumber Iva SC</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly house," begin with the exterior. Underground water mains are typically blue in color (they can also be black or gray). The pipe is normally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it gets in the home near the hot water heater. Your main shut down is connected to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you examine both ends of the pipe. We have discovered cases where the copper pipe gets in the house and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>Often a clog can be caused due to buildup and grease within the system. If this holds true, snaking the drain will not fix the concern. You might need to look into using a high pressure water supply to get rid of the clog. This procedure is a bit more pricey and will cost anywhere from $400-$ 1000, depending on the seriousness of the clog. There are two standard piping materials used by plumbing specialists. PEX and copper both offer various benefits and advantages such as removing the metal taste from your water.</p>
