<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Assures?

The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the firmness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have actually maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regrowth). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the highly concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you contributed to the tank).
