<p>Water softening makes use of a process called "ion exchange" to get rid of liquified hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, manganese and iron. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the hard water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in the softener and a trace amount of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY project.
