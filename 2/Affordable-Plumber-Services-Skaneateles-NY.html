<p>A total repipe of a home's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most complex and costly plumbing task, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in whole house repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can cause rust that obstructs the line. Just 4" of water pressure can be enough to block a natural gas line. Noise-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets hard and removes from the capacity of your hot water heater. This hardened sediment is likely the source of the sound.</p>
