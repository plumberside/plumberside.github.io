Sediment Build-Up: If you see unusual popping, banging, or clanging noises originating from your system, this might be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is causing a response with the heating component. Lacking warm water rapidly is another sign of sediment build-up, since the sediment is using up more space in the tank, so your water for that reason takes longer to heat. To fix this problem, you will likely need to flush out the tank.</p>
