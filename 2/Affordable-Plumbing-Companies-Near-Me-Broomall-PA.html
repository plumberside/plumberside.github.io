<p>Old, worn, or harmed plumbing pipes can cause considerable problems. Even little leakages can slowly dampen walls and floorings until they become breeding premises for mold, mildew, and other irritants.

A strange, gurgling noise originating from the toilet whenever you flush or from the bathtub drain after you took a bath is never ever a great sign. Possibilities are your sewer line is clogged, and a plunger may not suffice to resolve this problem. Call a plumber instantly.</p>
