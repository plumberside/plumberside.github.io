<p>A cross-connection is any irreversible or momentary connection between a public water system or consumer's potable (i.e., drinking) water supply and any source or system consisting of nonpotable water or other substances. An example is the piping between a public water supply or consumer's potable water supply and an auxiliary water system, cooling system or watering system.</p>
<p>If you've ever been annoyed by cloudy white areas on your dishes that will not go away, white t-shirts that turn dull and gray after a couple of washes, or a persistent layer of soap scum in your shower, you'll enjoy to know that water softening can eliminate these problems and more. Hard water triggers these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash. With softened water, you won't need to stress over any issues with mineral deposits sticking around. This makes chores simpler and less annoying for everybody involved.</p>
