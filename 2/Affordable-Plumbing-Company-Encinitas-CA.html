<h2>Tips To Hire Residential Plumbing Contractor in Encinitas</h2>

<p>Backflow is bad news. The prevention of backflow contaminants into drinkable water supply is crucialÂ not just in industrial and commercial applications, but also in residential systems. Conbraco, Febco, and Wilkins are three of the biggest suppliers of industrial-grade backflow prevention assemblies.Â Control your water supply and pressure with a backflow preventer noted here.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this certification, and a plumbing license is not required to get this certification. I've consulted a few plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, however I would anticipate the cost to be substantially less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
