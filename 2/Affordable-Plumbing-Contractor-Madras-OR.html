<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and a terrific guy. He informed me exactly what to anticipate (cost, time, procedure) up front and delivered as promised. I will definitely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Installing a garbage disposal takes 2 to 3 hours with a typical hourly rate of $25 to $70.
