Once it has passed through the valve, a backflow prevention assembly is a mechanical valve arrangement designed to avoid the reversal of the flow of water. The 2 types of pipes that we choose to utilize for repiping are copper and PEX. These are two very various materials, however they both have incredible resilience and durability.</p>
