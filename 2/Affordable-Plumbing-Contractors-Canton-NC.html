<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
