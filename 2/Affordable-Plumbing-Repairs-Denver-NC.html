<p>Water softening makes use of a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, manganese, iron and magnesium. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular response is needed. Water softeners have resin beads that hold onto salt, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the sodium is switched for the tough water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace quantity of sodium flows out with the softened water.</p>

Before you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>
