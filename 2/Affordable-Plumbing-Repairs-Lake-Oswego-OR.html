Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be warmed and readily available for use. Also, deterioration of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion, request that a new one be set up.</p>
