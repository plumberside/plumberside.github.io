<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading items from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, triggering them to scale, flake, and become breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system becomes weak and might stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Improper installation is also a typical cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to discover.</p>

<p>The Phoenix Uniform Plumbing Code secures the general public water supply and personal on-site water system and distribution systems by restricting cross-connections in between safe and clean (suitable for drinking) and non-potable water supply, and by needing installation of primary and secondary backflow prevention methods.
