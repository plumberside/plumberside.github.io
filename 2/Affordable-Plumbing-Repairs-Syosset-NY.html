Normally, they start little and go undetected, and after time can result in big puddles beneath your sink and cabinets. This type results in possible water damage. A lot of other kinds of leaky kitchen sinks which are annoying but are generally repaired easily.

He also did the job faster than initial estimated, so the work was less costly than I expected. I will utilize Gotelli Plumbing again in the future.</p>
