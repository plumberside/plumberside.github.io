<p>Gas is the one we are most carefully exposed to. This gas is used for heating our houses, for lightening our stoves, and for running appliances such as hot water heater. This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or swamp gas. Methane is a naturally taking place gas that takes place in the earth's crust and is also in some cases formed by the decaying of raw materials like sewage or manure. As useful as this gas is, the functions that make this gas harmful is its odorless and colorless nature, that makes it a quiet killer.
