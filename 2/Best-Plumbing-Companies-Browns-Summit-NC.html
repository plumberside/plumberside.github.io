<p>Backpressure backflow is triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in drinkable supply of water pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
