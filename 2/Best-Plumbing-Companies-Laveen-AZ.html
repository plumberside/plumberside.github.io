<p>Hellenbrand water softeners and conditioners eliminate calcium and magnesium from your water, leaving it softer and cleaner. Basically, soft water conserves you cash. Decreased Pressure Backflow Prevention Assembly (RP): An RP is a mechanical backflow preventer that consists of 2 separately acting, spring-loaded check valves with a hydraulically operating, mechanically independent, spring-loaded pressure differential relief valve in between the check valves and listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line avoids them from closing entirely, backflow can occur.</p>
