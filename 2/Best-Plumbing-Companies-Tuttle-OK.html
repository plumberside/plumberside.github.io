When the resin beads have actually maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and changed with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
