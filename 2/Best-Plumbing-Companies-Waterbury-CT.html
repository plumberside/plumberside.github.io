How to inform if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we suggest having them replaced right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you need to first get the needed license( s) for the work you plan to do. You can take a look at our License page to learn more on getting an authorization. Once you get an authorization you can start with the work. Nevertheless, you should require inspection before you conceal any work or cover.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the time, it's safe to state that any repairs that need to be finished will come out of the pocketbook of a house owner.

Public water systems such as the City Utilities Department must meet or go beyond the state requirements and carry the duty for implementing them.</p>
