These materials collect in the drain and ultimately harden against the pipe walls, making them hard to eliminate. Your water heater is leaking: Hot water heater leaks are among the most common indications that your unit is at completion of its lifespan, specifically if they are causing significant flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>
