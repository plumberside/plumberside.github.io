<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I chose this company since they had great reviews and a reasonable price, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a substantial, revolting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a fantastic task tidying up after it also.</p>
