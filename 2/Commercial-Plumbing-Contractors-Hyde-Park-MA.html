You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you notice your water has an unusual flow, color, smell or taste. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a fast fix or the result of other issues in your home's plumbing system. More complicated problems with water temperature or pressure may need changing the hot water heater, which generally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending upon capability and type.</p>
