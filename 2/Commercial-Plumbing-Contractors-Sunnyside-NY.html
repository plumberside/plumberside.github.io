Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester interprets the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
