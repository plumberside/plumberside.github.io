While water overuse is a problem for your wallet, it's also an issue for the environment. Old-fashioned water softening systems that aren't saltless can consume to 25 gallons of water every day for their regrowth process. That's 700 gallons of water a month simply to keep your water softener up and running.</p>
<p>Keep in mind: Tough water stops your washing detergent from working successfully because difficult water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them. You, therefore, have to utilize more and more cleaning agent to accomplish the exact same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt solution. Difficult minerals captured in the resin (or zeolite) are launched and the media gets renewed with salt ions. The water softener is likewise cleaned and decontaminated during regeneration. Finally, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
