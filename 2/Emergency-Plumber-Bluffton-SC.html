<h3>What Causes Pipe and Drain Clogs in Bluffton SC 29910?</h3>
<p>If you've always resided in an area with difficult water, you may not realize just how much it affects you-- but if you have actually just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, inflamed skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from hard water. Difficult water hinders the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water likewise makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that tough water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red frequently.</p>
<p>A. Normally wax does not "go bad" on a standard floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, ensure the leak isn't originating from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "normal" undetected problem. Attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours if you aren't sure where the leak is coming from.</p>
