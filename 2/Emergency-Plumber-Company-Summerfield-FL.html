<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure occur whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
