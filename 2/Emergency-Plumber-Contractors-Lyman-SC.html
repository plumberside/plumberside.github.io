Inspect to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can pick the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and readily available for usage. Also, deterioration of the tank's components can trigger the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of rust, demand that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
