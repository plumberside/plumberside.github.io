<p>In some families, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to approach when searching for a viable option, particularly when basic plunging does not appear to work. However, there are many drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they normally consist of substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by liquifying whatever is triggering a clog, which can range from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little objects, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the threat of damage to your house and family.</p>
