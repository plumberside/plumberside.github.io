<p>The pipe-bursting method is used on pipes that are significantly damaged, for replacing an entire pipe system, or for repairing larger areas of sewer pipeline The installers need physical access to the pipe in order to start repair, which includes two 4 foot square gain access to pits at either end of the pipeline. The installers begin by putting a "bursting head" at the access point on one end of the pipe. Hydraulic power is used to drag the head through the pipe.

<p>In some cases, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the workings of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's task to know what the field test data means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester translates the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
