When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When difficult water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>

Sodium will not trigger lime scale or soap residue buildup like other minerals do, and water softening includes only an extremely small amount of salt to your water.
