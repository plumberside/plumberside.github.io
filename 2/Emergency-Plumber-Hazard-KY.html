<p>Sewer linings can assist to repair broken pipes without having to totally replace your sewer lines or damage the area around them. Daily use should not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you bump into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To avoid this from occurring, install the unit in a steady and safe location. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, secure the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener does not tip over and remove the plumbing. You should wait until after the cycle is finished and then examined the system for fractures or broken fittings if your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration. You should also inspect to make certain your drain line is never blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
<p>Each part of the assembly need to be evaluated to identify what requires repair.
