Nevertheless, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in. This is an option to think about if you live in an older house - such as one constructed pre-1970 - or any home with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular option for house plumbing for many years, but steel eventually struggles with corrosion and does not have the sturdiness of today's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
