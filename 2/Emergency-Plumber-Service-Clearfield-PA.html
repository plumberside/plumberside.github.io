<p>E.R. Services comprehends the value of maintaining the stability and performance of your kitchen. Minerals such as calcium and magnesium, both have a favorable charge. Sodium, the mineral that water softeners utilize to replace solidity ions, likewise has a positive charge, so none of these ions are brought in to each other. Nevertheless, sodium's charge is weaker than that of calcium and magnesium. If ions aren't drawn in to each other, how can an exchange take place? There is one other important element required to make the process work: a resin bed including lots of small, negatively-charged beads.</p>
<p>Inspect Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers available that you might run into. The very first is a check valve. The second is a dual check".

And there's no remedy for a leaking tank.</p>
