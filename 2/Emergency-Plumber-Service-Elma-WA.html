<p>If you need a water softener is a personal preference, figuring out. Water softener systems work by eliminating hardness minerals and changing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to inhibit the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself.
