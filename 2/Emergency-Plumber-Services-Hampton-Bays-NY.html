<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most expensive and detailed plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or device whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can trigger a clog or can trigger deterioration that blocks the line.

I 'd love to post some images of this. Just look on line. The issue does exist.</p>
