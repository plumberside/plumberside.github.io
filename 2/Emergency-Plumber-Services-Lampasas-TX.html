<h3>Shower Repairs in Lampasas TX 76550 - The Processes Involved</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water supply.</p>
