<p>No, you should NOT put caustic chemical drain cleaners down your drains if you're major about protecting your drain and plumbing system. The factor is that these chemical cleaners can be even more harmful than useful, potentially gnawing at your pipes. Repiping is the replacement of either a single pipe or a house's whole plumbing system, consisting of both supply of water and drain lines. Usually, a whole-house repipe is worth the financial investment in the long run since it may attend to the root cause of the persistent plumbing problems in your home.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are developed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems typically are set up in locations where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages.

If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to discharge from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>
