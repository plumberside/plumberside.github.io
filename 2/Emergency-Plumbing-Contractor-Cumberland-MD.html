<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the drinkable water system pressure, or a mix of both.
