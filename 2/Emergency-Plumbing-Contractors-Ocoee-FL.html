<p>Before our professional technicians can begin applying their skills and experience, we initially need to ensure that the line is properly cleaned up and gotten ready for our repair work. Our repair processes rely on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections caused by waste accumulation can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls effectively. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that allows for a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water straight into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the whole size of the sewer line and offer a mindful cleaning.</p>
