Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is developed due to the fact that of the process. When galvanized pipe is directly connected to copper pipe, a typical example of this is. It is also worth keeping in mind that while using a brass fitting to bridge the gap between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely prevent it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact in between the different metals. A dielectric coupling consists of an insulating material that physically separates contact in between the two metals.</p>
