<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust much more quickly. Consistent gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete component and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to function at its best.</p>
