<p>Permanent magnetic water conditioning gadgets have actually been marketed based upon a variety of claims concerning their impact on water hardness and related scale formation.

<p>Plainly the resin is not a limitless exchange website. When all the sodium exchange websites are replaced with hardness minerals, the resin is spent and will no longer soften water. At this moment, the water softener will need to be operated on an alternate cycle called regeneration. Throughout this cycle, resin is backwashed with a salt solution. The brine is reverse flushed through the system taking with it the calcium and magnesium ions that had actually been adsorbed on the resin. The softener can be returned to use when backwashing is complete. Some water softeners will automatically change to the operation cycle. Others have a manual switch. Figure 1 shows both cycles of the water softening process-ion exchange and regeneration.</p>
