<p>It's an oddly complex scientific process, however simple to remedy. It utilizes salt to get rid of minerals and smells found in difficult water- most typically calcium and magnesium.

<p>The salt water tank help the water softening system in regeneration. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is decreasing, the heavy brine option is drawn out of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the unit will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
