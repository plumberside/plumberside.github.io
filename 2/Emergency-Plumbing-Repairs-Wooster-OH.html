<p>First consider your choices if you are looking to replace an existing underground sewer pipe that has actually begun to leak. A full sewer pipe replacement might not be essential. Often, relining your existing pipes is a better option. If your sewer lines are below trees, near substantial landscaping, pathways, driveways or other semi-permanent functions, overall sewer excavation can cause a good deal of civilian casualties (and expenditure) to the surrounding area.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a used flapper is typically the perpetrator. However not constantly. Initially, look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 demonstrates how to set the slack perfect.</p>
