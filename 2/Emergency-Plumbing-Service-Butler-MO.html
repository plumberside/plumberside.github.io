Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, however they need to be carefully developed and set up to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
