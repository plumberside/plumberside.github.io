Utilize a solution of baking soda and vinegar occasionally to keep your drains and waste disposal unit clean. You can use an organic drain cleaner regular monthly to keep your drains clear. We recommend natural items, such as Bio-Clean, because they work better than products including extreme chemicals and will not trigger damage to your drains or fixtures.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are one of the most common plumbing problems plumbers deal with, and for lots of people, it's an emergency when the toilet is all set to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can buy at your local hardware store.
