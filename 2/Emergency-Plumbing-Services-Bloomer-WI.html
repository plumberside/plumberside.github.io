<p>The trick to avoiding a clogged waste disposal unit is moderation.

<p>It typically symbolizes rust and mineral buildup if you observe low water pressure or stained water. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you might discover lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
