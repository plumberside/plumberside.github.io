<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a requirement more than a need. Once the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air should be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close effectively. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
