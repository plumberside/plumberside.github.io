<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. This large amount of garbage does not need to enter the garbage can if it can easily and rapidly be disposed of through the sink.

By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by saving the quantity of trash that gets sent to land fills and other discarding locations.
