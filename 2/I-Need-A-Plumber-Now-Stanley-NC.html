<h3>Plumbing Drainage & Heating Stanley NC</h3>
<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the safe and clean supply of water pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water supply pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in potable water system pressure take place whenever the amount of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
