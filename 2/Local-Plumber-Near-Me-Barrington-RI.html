Toilet leakages around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>So now that you know you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Unfortunately, main line clogs are not something a homeowner can fix.
