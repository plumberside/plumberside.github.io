<p>An overall repipe of a house's water supply, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most pricey and intricate plumbing job, states Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company focusing on entire house repiping. Recent Review: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos got to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the house and area of the pipe, it was a challenging task. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>
