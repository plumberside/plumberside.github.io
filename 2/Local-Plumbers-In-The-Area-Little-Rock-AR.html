<p>Clark's Process: This procedure is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which triggers the solidity ions to precipitate. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide must be added to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most expensive factors aren't the equipment or products utilized, however the uprooting, landscaping and lawn damage that takes place.</p>
<p>The source or place of a sewer issue identifies who pays for repair. The City is accountable for the public right-of-way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is accountable for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet broad) where main sewage systems pass through private property are an exception to this rule.</p>
