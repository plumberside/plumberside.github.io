<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming safe and clean water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or reduced pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or neighboring firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the decreased pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
