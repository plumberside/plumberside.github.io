<p>As the water treatment industry has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually frequently been misinterpreted as a purifying, cleansing or conditioning process. This is due mostly to overstated advertising and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal preference not need. Nevertheless, water softening does have benefits, and downsides, that make this choice a considerable one.</p>
<p>Breathing in dripped gas in an indoor space, such as your house can lead to a lack of oxygen in the air and cause hypoxia.

<p>Brine Valve - Controls water flow in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to avoid overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water material of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not filtered through the earth is an exceptionally pure kind of water. When water evaporates it leaves liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
