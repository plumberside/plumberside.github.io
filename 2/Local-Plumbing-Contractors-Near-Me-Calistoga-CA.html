<p>Check the washer for wear or cracks when you get rid of the cap to flush out the valve. Changing a bad washer is simple and inexpensive. However discovering the right washer might not be. The most common washers are frequently offered in your home centers and hardware shops. Other designs can be difficult to find.

<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.

When a trained tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
