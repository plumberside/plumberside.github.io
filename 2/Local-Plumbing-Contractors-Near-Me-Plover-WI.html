<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is typically the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable or drain auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of accumulation. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
