It has two spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open up to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
