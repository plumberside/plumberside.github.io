<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can build up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a complete repipe in specific neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
