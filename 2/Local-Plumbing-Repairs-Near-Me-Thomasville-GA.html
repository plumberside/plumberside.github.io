<p>Examine the house's hot water heater You will be seeking to see if it is huge enough to accommodate your requirements (a household of four need to have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it lies, and the hot water heater's age. Check to see if there is an accumulation of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can decide on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will indicate that less water will be heated and offered for use. Likewise, corrosion of the tank's elements can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see obvious signs of corrosion, demand that a brand-new one be installed.</p>
