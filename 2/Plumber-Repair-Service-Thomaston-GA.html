Once the system is pressurized, air needs to be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to guarantee no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are completely open and alert the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
