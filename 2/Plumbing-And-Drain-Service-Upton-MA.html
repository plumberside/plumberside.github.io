The age of your home is a critical component to understand whether you must repipe your home.

If your house was built prior to the 1970s, we highly advise that you hire a plumbing professional to check your home's plumbing and inspect if there are areas that need repiping. If your house was built decades before that, chances are that your home may need substantial repiping so that your house's plumbing can function at optimal rates.</p>
