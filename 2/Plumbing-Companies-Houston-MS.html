<p>In this situation, dirty water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You also need to invest in a backflow valve if you see your water has an uncommon flow, taste, odor or color. A plumbing professional can identify whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other problems in your home's plumbing system.

After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride solution ends up being a waste stream that goes down the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
