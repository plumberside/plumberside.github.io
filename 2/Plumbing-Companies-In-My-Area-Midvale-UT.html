<p>Food scraps compose approximately 20% of all household waste. If it can quickly and rapidly be disposed of through the sink, this big amount of garbage does not need to go in the garbage can.

By installing a garbage disposal you are helping the environment by conserving the quantity of trash that gets sent out to garbage dumps and other dumping locations. With a garbage disposal the trash is handled through already existing water infrastructure.</p>
