Section 312.10 of the Ohio Plumbing Code covers the installation, repairs and testing of seclusion backflow preventers (BFP) and Section 608 of the Ohio Plumbing Code addresses protection of the potable supply of water within a structure these gadgets are called isolation" BFP. Again, the very best kind of backflow prevention is an air gap, such as the outlet of a faucet and where water would flow over the rim of a sink or bathtub.

<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high risk" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is used in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
