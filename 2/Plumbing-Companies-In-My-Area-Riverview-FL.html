In this method, water is treated with a calculated amount of washing soda (Na2CO3) which transforms the chlorides and sulphates of calcium and magnesium into their respective carbonates which get precipitated.</p>

<p>Home water softeners, also called ion exchange units, are devices that eliminate calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for sodium or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become filled with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option ends up being a waste stream that decreases the drain and eventually into the environment.</p>
<p>Pieces that comprise kitchen sink drains can end up being corroded and worn, leading to leakages. Depending on the seriousness of the situation, just one piece may need replacement, or the whole under-sink assembly must be gotten rid of and replaced. Elements involved include slip nut joints and washers, tubing leading from the sink, P-trap or S-trap assemblies and sink drain baskets. Improperly set up P-traps or S-traps that are propped up or are not secured by nut joints and washers, must be reconfigured.</p>

<p>These branching distribution pipelines form networks and loops including water pipe and supply pipelines. Water mains range in size from 6 inches, to 8, 10, 12, and 16 inches in diameter.

Depending upon the circulation capacity, area and age of the pipe system, these pipelines are made from a variety of materials: polyvinyl chloride (PVC), high density polyethylene (HDPE), cast iron, ductile iron, copper, steel, asbestos cement, and even smaller-diameter reinforced concrete.</p>
