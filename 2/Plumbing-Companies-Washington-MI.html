This leads to micro-fractures and decreases the standard structural integrity of the system. The system ends up being weak and might stop working without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to spot.</p>
