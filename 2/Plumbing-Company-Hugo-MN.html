As a safety precaution, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives natural gas an odor typically connected with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this unique scent allows you to smell a possible leak. Constantly leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>Button Plumbing was great. They changed my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely use them for any future plumbing requirements. I was incredibly delighted with their service.</p>
