<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only abandon the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost extremely quickly.
