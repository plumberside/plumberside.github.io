<p>The salt water tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds a highly concentrated solution of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' positive charge. Salt is manually added to the brine tank in the type of pellets or blocks. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capacity of the resin is lessening, the heavy brine option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. The water passing through the system will no longer be softened if the brine tank runs out of salt.</p>
<p>There are two kinds of piping that are used in the repiping process. Because of their security, performance and cost, copper piping and PEX piping are used.
