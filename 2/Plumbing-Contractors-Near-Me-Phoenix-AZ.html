<p>Backflow indicates the unwanted turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the safe and clean supply of water; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from happening. Points at which a safe and clean water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashers, however they must be thoroughly developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another typical place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>

But more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200).
