<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure. It is essential that the plumbing system be turned on really slowly to guarantee no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to make sure no valves were accidentally left open or did not close correctly when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
