<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The water supply line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an unfavorable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries contaminants back to the primary water supply system, making the water in it unsafe to consume.</p>
