<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is greater than the pressure of the incoming potable water supply. Backpressure can be caused by pumps or temperature level increases in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water supply pressure. Backsiphonage occurs when negative or reduced pressure establishes in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, normally due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or nearby firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is set up on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the building. A common type of backflow preventer is the lowered pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
