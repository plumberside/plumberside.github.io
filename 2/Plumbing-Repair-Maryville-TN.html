<p>Echologics has a long history of developing acclaimed acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (usually from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be utilized to evaluate the type and condition of underground pipes, and to recognize problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, clogs, rust or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to discover the cause of periodic sewer backups or other ongoing problems, or when selling or buying an older house.</p>
<p>Other than for domestic pump and pump and watering systems, certification is not needed to install plumbing systems beyond a structure (e.g., water lines connected directly to community water mains, sewer line connections, and so on).
