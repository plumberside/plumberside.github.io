<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but also has a third check valve that is in fact a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve uses an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will permit backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you require water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
