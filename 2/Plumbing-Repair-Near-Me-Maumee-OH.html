<p>Particles such as foreign objects - Things such as soap, hair, food and even little toys can become trapped between your drain and your pipes. These will eventually block the flow of your water before triggering a clog. Also, if too much toilet paper is flushed down your toilet, or hygienic items are flushed, a clog can occur.

<h3>How Often Should Plumbing Check Maumee OH</h3>
<p>Also called a garbage disposer, a garbage disposal can be found in 2 fundamental types - continuous feed, which normally has a wall-mounted switch so the system keeps running as you drop more waste in; and batch feed, which requires a food cover be in place to run the system.
