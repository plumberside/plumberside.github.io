<p>If you hear water running in your toilet and you think a leaky toilet tank or toilet bowl, try this: squirt a few drops of food coloring to the toilet tank and let the toilet sit for about half an hour. After 30 minutes, examine to see if any of the water in your toilet bowl has actually altered color. If it has, you more than likely have a leak.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not uncommon, however if your toilet is clogging more than three times a month, there's a bigger problem to analyze. You may need to change toilet paper or hire a plumber to clear a blockage from the drain if your toilet is relatively new.
