<h3>Water Line Repairs in Wenatchee Washington</h2>
<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to remove dissolved tough water minerals such as calcium, manganese, magnesium and iron. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the difficult water streams through the resin, the salt is switched for the hard water minerals. The difficult water minerals are trapped in the softener and a trace amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
