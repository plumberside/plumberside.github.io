<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Features automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is probably from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not filtered through the earth is an extremely pure type of water. When water evaporates it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when vaporized water ultimately falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>A common whole-house repipe can take anywhere from 3 to five days, depending on the size of the home, the number of levels it has and the selected pipe material. During a repipe, plumbers will make tactical cuts in the drywall, totally replace the pipes, re-install the gotten rid of drywall and spot it to eliminate any indications of damage or alteration to your house.</p>
