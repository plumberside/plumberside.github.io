<p>In some households, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when looking for a feasible solution, especially when basic plunging doesn't seem to work.

The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your home and family.</p>
