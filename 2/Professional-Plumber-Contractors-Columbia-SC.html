<p>If you discover low water pressure or blemished water, it generally signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might see lower water pressure.

Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can become a health danger in your water.</p>
<p>A knowledgeable plumber like Matt Mertz Plumbing, Inc. can help you choose when it's time to replace your pipes. As piping installation and repair specialists, we can fix problems or explain when it will be much safer or more economical to just redo your piping system.
