<p>The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania currently has no licensure or accreditation requirements for a lot of building contractors (or their staff members). The secret to the technology is having the ability to control both the crystal development rate and their elimination from our polymer beads, consequently removing hardness ions and producing a water softening benefit that does not need replacement chemicals or regrowth of active sites," stated Dr. Rakesh Govind, co-founder of SofTap Water and primary technology officer. This innovation is more cost reliable and lasts longer than common water softening products such as ion exchange or reverse osmosis," continued Dr. Govind.</p>
<p>Filtration in sink taps and fridge water dispensers improves water's taste, however its high price tag makes it impractical as a household service. Packaged chemicals soften water in small batches, such as washing machine loads, but render the water undrinkable, take a toll on clothes, and, sometimes, include phosphates that damage the environment. A clogged sewer pipe could leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
