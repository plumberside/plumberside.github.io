The backflow preventer might be required on the water service line, within the building, or in both locations.

Assemblies not currently noted should have been noted at the time of the original installation.</p>
<p>For nonemergency jobs-- a remodel or restorative deal with your plumbing-- you need a pro who understands residential-system style and understands the code in your area. He also has to have the ability to operate in a finished environment. That suggests putting down a piece of scrap carpets to secure floors and cutting precise, easy-to-repair holes in walls, and, then, only when necessary.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that doesn't drain properly or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist. Sometimes drain repair needs can be solved reasonably rapidly by an experienced handyman. At other times, however, portions of a drain may need to be dismantled, examined, and cleared before being changed. Sometimes, a handyman may determine that a replacement part is necessary (like a tailpiece, reducer, or PVC  trap) to ensure typical operation for your drain. Call a Sears Handyman agent today to talk about repair choices.</p>
