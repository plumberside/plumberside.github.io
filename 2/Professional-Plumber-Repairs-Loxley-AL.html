<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the potable water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being supplied, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
