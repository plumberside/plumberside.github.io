<p>A partial reroute is essentially a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where jackhammering and fixing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in particular areas, based upon our experience.</p>
