<p>As the water treatment market has grown in the U.S., the idea of water softening has actually typically been misconstrued as a purifying, cleaning or conditioning process. This is due mostly to exaggerated marketing and, in part, to customer misunderstandings about water treatment.

The decision "to soften or not to soften" is a matter of personal choice not need. However, water softening does have benefits, and disadvantages, that make this choice a significant one.</p>
