<p>Homeowners typically ask if a gas water heater or an electric unit is more cost-effective. The response depends upon your home. While gas designs are cheaper to operate, they do need an existing natural gas line. The cost of an electric water heater is normally lower, however it can be more expensive to run. Electric varieties are likewise simpler to install, and unlike gas units, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as grease, food, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's drain, snake or cable television auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's DIY task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who knows the drill.</p>
