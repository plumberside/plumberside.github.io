<p>Aside from these two crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, possibly less important things that can degrade or break. For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Constant gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising correctly, you may need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. Tank covers can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the step of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to express the strength of the acidity of a solution. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are substances that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up corrosion Carbon dioxide will potentially contribute to the development of carbonic acid, consequently making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of co2 tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
