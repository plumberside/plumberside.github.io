<p>In 1939, after his Roto-Rooter sewer cleaning machine showed successful, Sam Blanc created and developed a smaller sized design that ran on the exact same principle but might clean and clear bathroom and kitchen sink drains along with laundry drains and other household plumbing drains. Blanc also built a much larger variation of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be hauled by a truck and included a 10 hp gas engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It was capable of cleaning large industrial and municipal sewer pipes. An improved variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that might also thread telephone cable. It was stopped in 1973.</p>
