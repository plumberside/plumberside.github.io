<p>Viking SupplyNet's comprehensive stock of backflow valves and related devices includes leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public supply of water respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural integrity of the system. The system becomes weak and may stop working without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal effects. Inappropriate installation is likewise a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be nearly impossible to identify.</p>
