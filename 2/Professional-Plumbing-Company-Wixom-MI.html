However, they add another layer of defense that makes them essentially sure by likewise locating a hydraulically run differential relief valve listed below the very first check valve.</p>
<p>Whenever the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow.
