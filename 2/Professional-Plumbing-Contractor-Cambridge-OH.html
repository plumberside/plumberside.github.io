<p>When the parts are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off remains in the closed position. This enables the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an exact motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any accumulated air should be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from vital areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in an area where the air will accumulate.</p>

<h3>Necessary Plumbing Services From Plumbing Contractors Cambridge OH</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't reverse through them, so the valves need to prevent backflow.  The obvious issue with this is that if the backflow takes place at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve needs to stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if totally closed, has great seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves used for watering systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and fully closed.</p>
