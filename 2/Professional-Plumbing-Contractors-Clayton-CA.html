<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work before it's covered; you do not get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor knows the indicators of quality work that you might miss, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, effectively sized holes in joists, studs, and floorings. Lastly, a quality contractor will not threat dealing with a substandard plumber. A simple error-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can quickly ravage $10,000 worth of walls or hardwood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and lawsuits. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with just the best.</p>
