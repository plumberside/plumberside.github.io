Houses built in the very first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes might seep into the drinking water, not to mention the health hazards connected with lead.</p>
<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. If your toilet is relatively new, you might need to switch bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain. The National Contractor License Service preserves a list of each state's professional licensing firm where you can search for your state's licensing info. Examine the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>

And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut begin at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for as much as 2 hours and $175 per hour for each additional hour.</p>
