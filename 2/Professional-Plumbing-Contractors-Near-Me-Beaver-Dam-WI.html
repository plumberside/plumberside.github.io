<p>When to repair: Toilet obstructions are not unusual, however if your toilet is clogging more than 3 times a month, there's a larger problem to analyze. If your toilet is relatively new, you might need to switch bathroom tissue or work with a plumber to clear an obstruction from the drain.

Examine the list of state licensing firms to discover whether a plumber is licensed in your state. Angie's List also preserves a licensing tool to examine state licensing requirements.</p>
