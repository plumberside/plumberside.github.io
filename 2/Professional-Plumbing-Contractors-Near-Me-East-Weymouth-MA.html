<h3>Emergency Plumbing Services East Weymouth MA</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to attend to difficult water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water can be found in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are pulled out of the water and changed with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Malfunctions: Modern water heaters also depend on electrical elements. If something inside the unit stops working, you might be entrusted no warm water The discharge line is pressurized and can run some range. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain? Even a kitchen or bathroom sink drain will make better connection than running outside.</p>
