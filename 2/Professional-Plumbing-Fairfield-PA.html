It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey cost going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
<p>In some homes, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to technique when looking for a feasible option, particularly when simple plunging doesn't appear to work. However, there are many downsides to using these harmful products - not least of which is that they typically include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering an obstruction, which can vary from the usual suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, small items, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them effective, however at the cost of providing the threat of harm to your house and household.</p>
