<p>Toilet repair is one of the most common plumbing repairs done in houses today. This is most likely due to the fact that there are anywhere from 300 to 350 million toilets in the U.S. alone. Due to the huge number of toilets, we have fixed many toilets in houses throughout the Tampa area so we are very accustomed to the items used and how they are installed here in your area. We also have done many toilet replacements also; this is usually required when either a property owner decides to replace their toilet with possibly a more effective one or when a toilet is simply beyond repair.</p>
