<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is essential that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. Many backflow preventers are set up in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be set up in a vertical orientation, however it is very important that the assembly just be installed if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work effectively and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
