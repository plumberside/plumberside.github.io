The brine tank holds a highly concentrated service of salt (or often potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the brine tank in the form of blocks or pellets. These dissolve in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is diminishing, the heavy brine solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.

RPZ assemblies also feature two individually operating check valves. Nevertheless, they add another layer of defense that makes them basically secure by also finding a hydraulically operated differential relief valve below the first check valve.</p>

While ineffective in all cases, the installation of a soft seated check valve right away ahead of the RPZ will often hold the pressure consistent to the assembly in times of fluctuating supply pressure.</p>
