The majority of toilets are basic sized - suggesting a "will fit" seat is sufficient for safety and convenience. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Emblem. It truly isn't a good concept to utilize a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been particularly designed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight uniformly and could eventually cause cracks in the bowl.</p>
