<p>If you've always resided in an area with hard water, you may not recognize just how much it affects you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can result from difficult water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to utilize more. Hard water likewise makes it harder to wash soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp.

<p>Whether you're a house owner, business owner, or residential or commercial property supervisor, at some time you will probably need to call a plumber.

<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently raise the rod and listen. You may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A below). Flex the float arm if there is no adjustment screw. Make sure it's adjusted correctly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>
