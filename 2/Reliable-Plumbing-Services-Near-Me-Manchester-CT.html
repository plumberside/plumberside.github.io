The program utilizes small installation labels and random inspections instead of routine electrical and plumbing licenses for particular types of minor electrical and plumbing work. Your backflow preventer failed inspection due to excessive plant life. Please trim back your plants and schedule testing with a company from our certified tester list This should be completed within 1 month to avoid water service disturbance.</p>

However, while DCV systems are considered safe for most fire protection systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line prevents them from closing entirely, backflow can occur.</p>
