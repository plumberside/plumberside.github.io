<p>E.R. Services comprehends the importance of preserving the integrity and efficiency of your kitchen. Sediment Build-Up: If you observe odd popping, banging, or clanging sounds originating from your system, this could be an indicator that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a reaction with the heating element.
