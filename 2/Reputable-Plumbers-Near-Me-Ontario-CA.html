<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can arise from an increase in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the amount of water being provided, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
