Points at which a drinkable water system connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully developed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
