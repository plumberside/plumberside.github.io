<p>Reverse osmosis uses an applied pressure gradient across a semi permeable membrane to conquer osmotic pressure and get rid of water particles from the solution with hardness ions. The membrane has pores large enough to admit water molecules for passage; firmness ions such as Ca2+ and Mg2+ will not fit through the pores. The resulting soft supply of water is without hardness ions with no other ions being included. Membranes are a type of water filter requiring routine cleaning or replacement maintenance.</p>
<p>You've got a problem with over-running or leaking if the sound of your toilet continuously running is normal to you.
