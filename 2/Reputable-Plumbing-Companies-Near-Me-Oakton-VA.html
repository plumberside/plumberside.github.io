<p>This is among the main and first questions that you should ask yourself when it pertains to repiping and replacing plumbing in your house. The age of your home is a critical part to comprehend whether or not you must repipe your home. This is not only due to the fact that your plumbing has actually aged with time, however also because homes that were constructed prior to a particular time period are most likely to consist of galvanized steel, understood to be a metal that is out-of-date on the planet of plumbing and beyond due to its sensitivity to rust. If your home was developed prior to the 1970s, we strongly advise that you work with a plumbing professional to check your house's plumbing and examine if there are locations that need repiping. Opportunities are that your house might need extensive repiping so that your house's plumbing can work at ideal rates if your home was built decades prior to that.</p>

If owner chooses to abandon the well, the well will need to be inspected. An authorization for inspection may be acquired from the Well and Septic Division at (937) 225-4428.

<p>Often, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might need the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates data on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test data implies for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
