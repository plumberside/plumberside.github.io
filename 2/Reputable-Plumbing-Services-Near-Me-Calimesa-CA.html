It's so old that it is no longer able to press water through the toilet to totally clear the drain. This leads to your toilet having a consistent clogging issue.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most common plumbing issues plumbers face, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow.

Repiping is primarily done on old pipes that were integrated in the '70s and constructed out of galvanized metals.</p>
