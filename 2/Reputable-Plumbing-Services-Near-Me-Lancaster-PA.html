<h3>Find Registered Plumbers in  Lancaster PA</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation needs the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you identify if your structure needs a backflow preventer or multiple devices, or if you receive an exemption. Exemptions, which are approved in very uncommon cases where the building is deemed to not present a danger to the water supply, must be submitted with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your building has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you need to have a licensed professional file a record drawing of the device, in addition to an initial test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>

The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer reduces water service pressure to the building; additional, more substantial expenses can occur if the drop in water pressure ends up being a problem for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if setting up a pump or larger size water service and backflow prevention device would neutralize the pressure loss.</p>
