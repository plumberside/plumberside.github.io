<p>Do not put everything down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to see what you put down your garbage disposal. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when combined with water, and potentially trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and obstructions - think about composting or placing these items in the garbage. Additionally, grease and oil can cake and gather in your drain too. After ending up cooking, think about pouring remaining grease or oil into a container or bowl to set aside. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or quickly place in the garbage after it's solidified.</p>

<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your lawn. During a camera inspection, a sewer and drain technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images caught by the camera, we can identify any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>
