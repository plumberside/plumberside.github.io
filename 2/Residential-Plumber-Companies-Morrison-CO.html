<p>Once the components are put back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is prepared to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback turned off stays in the closed position. This allows the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air should be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be gotten rid of from critical areas in the assembly.

A toilet's tank is made up of multiple small moving parts, such as flapper valves and fill valves, that need to be replaced or fixed due to their frequent usage. When these parts wear, they result in tiny leaks that are difficult to see with the naked eye.
