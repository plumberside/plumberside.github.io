<p>Water firmness is the quantity of dissolved calcium and magnesium in the water-- difficult water is high in both calcium and magnesium. Since soap reacts with the calcium to form soap scum, the factor you can feel the difference on your skin is. This results in the need for more soap or detergent to get things clean.

Toilet leaks around the base can also occur around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring below the base of the toilet.</p>
