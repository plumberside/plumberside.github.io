<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or ruin the area around them. Daily usage need to not trigger a water softener to leak. Leaks can also occur if you run into the softener and jostle it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from occurring, install the unit in a safe and steady  place. If you live in an earthquake-prone area of the nation, secure the softener so that if the foundation starts moving, the softener does not fall over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking throughout regeneration, you should wait up until after the cycle is finished and after that inspected the system for fractures or broken fittings. You must also examine to make certain your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener during regeneration and flood your basement or garage.</p>
