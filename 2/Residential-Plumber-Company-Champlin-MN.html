It was installed 7 years back, and it never drained this well. I selected this company since they had excellent reviews and a reasonable cost, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job cleaning up after it also.</p>
