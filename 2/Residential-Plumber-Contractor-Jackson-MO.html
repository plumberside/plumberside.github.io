When these parts wear out, they result in tiny leaks that are hard to see with the naked eye. This is why it is essential to call a plumber as quickly as you presume you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not only does a leaking toilet drainage, it can also result in flooding and water damage.</p>

When installing a brand-new toilet, the plumber might also need to make adjustments to your bathroom's plumbing, which will raise the total cost of the task.</p>
