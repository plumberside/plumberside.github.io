<p>Wondering how much do plumbers charge to snake a drain? While each case of a clogged drain is different to the next, here are some rough estimates on what a plumber cost to snake a drain is. While there are a lot of variables that may enter into play, here is how plumbers normally charge for drain snaking. The waste disposal unit is clogged or gradually draining pipes. While a garbage disposal is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a waste disposal unit, leading to obstructions. Some items that need to never be taken into the disposal consist of fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, efficient, and an excellent guy. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and provided as assured. I will certainly use Clog Dawg once again. Installing a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average hourly rate of $25 to $70. These costs are in addition to the cost of the disposal system. The overall you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout charge that is higher than the labor cost for the work.</p>

We'll work to assess and repair the problem as efficiently and effectively as possible, getting your warm water heater up and running in no time.
