<h3>Helpful Tips For Choosing The Right Plumbing Service Chelsea MI</h3>
<p>The most effective way to address difficult water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the hardness ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and replaced with salt or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>The costs of water softeners are typically far surpassed by the benefits and cost savings obtained, through using softened water.
