<p>In water circulation systems, water is usually preserved at a significant pressure to allow water to stream from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be decreased when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is all of a sudden high demand on the water supply (for example, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Reduced pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>Strainers are advised prior to each backflow prevention assembly on non-fire combating water lines.
