<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Guarantees? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This process is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their capability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a procedure called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are cleaned with the extremely concentrated saltwater option (salt water) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine forces the calcium and magnesium ions to be launched from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Inspect the house's hot water heater You will be looking to see if it is big enough to accommodate your needs (a household of 4 must have at least a 40 gallon tank), where it is located, and the water heater's age.

Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will mean that less water will be warmed and offered for use. Likewise, rust of the tank's elements can trigger the tank to have a brief life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of corrosion, request that a new one be set up.</p>
