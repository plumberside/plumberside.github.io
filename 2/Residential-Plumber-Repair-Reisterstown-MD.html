<p>These men were remarkable! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has been a problem on and off for many years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had excellent evaluations and a fair rate, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (actually), and they did an excellent job tidying up after it too.</p>
