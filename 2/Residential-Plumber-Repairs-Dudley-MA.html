Blanc also built a much bigger version of the Roto-Rooter machine called the Roto-Rooter Royal. It had to be pulled by a truck and featured a 10 hp fuel engine and 1000 feet of steel cable. It can cleaning large commercial and local sewer pipes. An enhanced variation called "The Mainliner" was introduced in 1958 that could also thread telephone cable television. It was discontinued in 1973.</p>
