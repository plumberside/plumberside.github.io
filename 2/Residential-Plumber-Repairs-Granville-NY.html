<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is generally the perpetrator. However not always. Initially, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. It can tangle up and avoid the flapper from closing securely if there's too much slack in the chain. A chain with too little slack can cause problem too. Picture 3 shows how to set the slack just right.</p>
<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly invest far more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
