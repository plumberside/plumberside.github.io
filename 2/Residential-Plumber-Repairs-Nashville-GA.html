<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Fed Up With False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the sodium or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the outcome. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be charged (a process called regeneration). During this procedure, the resin beads are washed with the extremely focused saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>
<p>By itself, gas is colorless and odorless. The majority of energy companies add a sulfur substance to gas, which is where the rotten egg odor originates from.
