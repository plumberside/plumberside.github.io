<p>Organic debris, such as food, grease, or hair stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the cause of clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable television, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, however this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
