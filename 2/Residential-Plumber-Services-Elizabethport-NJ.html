As rust and minerals build up gradually, they restrict the flow of the water which is why you might observe lower water pressure. The discoloration occurs when rust becomes loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or deterioration can become a health risk in your water.</p>
