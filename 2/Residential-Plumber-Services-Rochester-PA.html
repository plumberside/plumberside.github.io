Water pressure may stop working or be reduced when a water pipe bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Decreased pressure in the pipe may enable contaminated water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
