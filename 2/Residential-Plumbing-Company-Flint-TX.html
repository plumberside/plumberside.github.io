<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and might sometimes leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink film is really a safe bacteria that comes from the sea salt. The Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) recommends switching to one of the other 2 types of salts if this stain is an annoyance in your home.
