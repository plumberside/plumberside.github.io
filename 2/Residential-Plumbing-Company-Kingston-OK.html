It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Fluctuations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will trigger an appropriately working RPZ assembly to regularly release small amounts of water. Throughout a backflow condition, a large volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be installed in locations subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage needs to also be provided.</p>
