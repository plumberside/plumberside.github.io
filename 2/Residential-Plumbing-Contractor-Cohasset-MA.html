<p>The most effective method to address hard water is with a water softener. When calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are collected by small resin beads through a process called ion exchange, water is softened. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When hard water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Electrical Breakdowns: Modern water heaters likewise depend on electrical components. If something inside the unit fails, you could be left with no warm water The discharge line is pressurized and can run some range. How far is the softener from the washing machine drain?
