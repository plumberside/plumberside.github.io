<p>Determining if you need a water softener is a personal choice. Water softener systems work by eliminating solidity minerals and replacing them with sodium ions. Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the solidity itself. Due to the fact that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are often considered a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to use salt. Water conditioners do not effectively get rid of hardness from the water supply, nevertheless, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>
