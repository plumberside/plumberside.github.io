While there are a lot of variables that may come into play, here is how plumbers typically charge for drain snaking. The garbage disposal is clogged or slowly draining. While a waste disposal unit is a helpful tool, not all food waste can be put through a garbage disposal, resulting in clogs. Some products that need to never be put into the disposal consist of fats, oils, grease, egg shells, potatoes, coffee grinds, rice, and bones.</p>
