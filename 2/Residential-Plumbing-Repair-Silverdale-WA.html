<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is accountable for the general public right of way (curb to curb), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their home line. Easements (generally 10 feet broad) where main sewers traverse personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions other than straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each location where you will have a gas home appliance must have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who installs gas piping on property not under their ownership must have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping installations require a permit and inspection.</p>
