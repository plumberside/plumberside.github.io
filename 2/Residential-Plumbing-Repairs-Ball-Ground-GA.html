Such connections happen naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be thoroughly designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
