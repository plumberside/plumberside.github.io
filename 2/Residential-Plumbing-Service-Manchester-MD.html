Sediment Build-Up: If you see odd popping, banging, or clanging noises coming from your unit, this might be a sign that sediment has actually built up in your tank, and is triggering a response with the heating element.

This gas is made from a hydrocarbon called methane, unofficially known as marsh gas or overload gas.
