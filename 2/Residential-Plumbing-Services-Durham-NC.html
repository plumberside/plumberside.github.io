<p>All piping under faucets and sinks are looked for leakages or damage. How to tell if you have polybutylene pipes: If your pipes are white plastic and include the letters PB" in the printed label, you have polybutylene pipes and we recommend having them replaced right now. Before you can ask for an inspection, you must initially obtain the needed permit( s) for the work you mean to do. You can check out our Permit page for more details on acquiring a license.

<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one man and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend a lot more. With this technique, you know the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
