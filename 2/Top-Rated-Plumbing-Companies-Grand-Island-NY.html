<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is important that the repair technician knows the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to ensure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly.

Most backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might cause the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>
