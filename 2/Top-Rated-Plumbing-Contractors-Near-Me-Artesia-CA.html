<p>Spotty dishes? All Garbage Disposals are not equal. We've dealt with almost every kind on the market today. We know that the type you pick depends upon your space, your cooking habits, your drain lines and your budget. Before you choose a brand-new disposal, offer us a call. We'll inspect your sink area, recommend a brand and install it. If your current disposal isn't working, let our plumbers take a look. In some cases a little fix can return it to working order.</p>
<p>By itself, gas is colorless and odorless. A lot of energy companies add a sulfur substance to natural gas, which is where the rotten egg smell originates from. That way, you can easily tell if you have a gas leak. For the most part, when a garbage disposal unit is no longer working, the motor has stopped working, and the overall cost of the repair will likely exceed the cost of setting up a brand-new system.</p>

<p>This is a bad indication. Toilets need to absolutely never wobble, move, or wiggle. It's not you, and it's not something you're doing.

Incorrectly seated and sealed toilets could leak, damage plumbing, or perhaps compromise the structural stability of the home.</p>
