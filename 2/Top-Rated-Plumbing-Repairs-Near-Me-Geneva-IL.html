<p>When drains are clogged, it is not always due to clogs that stem inside the home. It is possible for drains to end up being clogged due to tree roots, likewise referred to as tree root intrusion. When tree roots begin to make their way inside someone's main sewer line, there is potential for this to cause drain problems. The kind of drain pipes already set up, such as cast iron, clay, copper or plastic, will identify the level of the damage that tree roots can trigger to a sewer line.</p>
