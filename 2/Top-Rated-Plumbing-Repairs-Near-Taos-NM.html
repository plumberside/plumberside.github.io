This pressure distinction across the # 1 check valve keeps the relief valve in the closed position. If pressure in the Zone increases towards the supply pressure (within 2 to 3 psi), the Relief Valve discharges, preventing backflow (reverse motion of fluid).</p>

Grease: Never put grease, fats, or oils down your kitchen sink. Rather than washing away, these products often congeal to form nasty obstructions, which you might need a plumber to eliminate.</p>
<p>Clogged toilets are among the most typical plumbing concerns plumbers deal with, and for many individuals, it's an emergency when the toilet is ready to overflow. You can try to fix the clog yourself by using a plunger, which you can purchase your local hardware shop. The only function of salt in a water softener is to restore the resin beads that take the firmness out of water.</p>
<p>If you see low water pressure or discolored water, it typically signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals build up with time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The staining occurs when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health hazard in your water.</p>
