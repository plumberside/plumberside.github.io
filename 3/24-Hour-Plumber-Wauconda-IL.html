<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is necessary to enjoy what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when mixed with water, and possibly trigger a clog. Fruit and vegetable peels can likewise cause blockages and jams - think about composting or putting these products in the garbage. Furthermore, grease and oil can congeal and gather in your drain also. After ending up cooking, consider pouring leftover grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
