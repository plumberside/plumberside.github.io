<p>Gently lift the rod and listen if your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod. You may be able to stop the running by changing the float if the water shuts off. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted properly (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You don't have to clear the tank to make these changes.</p>
