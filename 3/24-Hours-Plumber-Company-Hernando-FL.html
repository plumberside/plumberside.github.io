<p>Remodeling plumbers usually charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their quotes are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200).

With this method, you know the turnkey cost going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
