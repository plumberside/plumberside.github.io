<h3>24 Hour Emergency Plumbing Waterford CT</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically kept at a considerable pressure to make it possible for water to flow from the tap, shower, or other component. Water pressure may fail or be lowered when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is suddenly high demand on the water system (for instance, when a number of fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow infected water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be prepared into the system.</p>
