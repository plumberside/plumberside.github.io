<h3>Why You Need Trustworthy Plumbing Services Afton OK</h3>
<p>The most reliable way to attend to tough water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the firmness ions-- are gathered by tiny resin beads through a process called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with sodium or potassium ions. When difficult water comes in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life expectancy of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are appropriately kept. Ensuring the brine tank never ever runs out of salt will extend the unit's life.  Safeguarding the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will likewise protect the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners boost the regrowth cycle and assistance relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
