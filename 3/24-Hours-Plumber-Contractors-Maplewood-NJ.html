<p>Test for water tightness by plugging the drain with the stopper and filling the sink with an inch of water. Check for leakages under the sink to validate that your plumber's putty is making a great seal. Remove the drain stopper, and enable the drain and P-trap to fill with water. Look for leakages and tighten up as essential. Plug system into a GFCI-protected receptacle, and arrange cables as preferred.</p>
<p>Water softeners normally have a life-span of 15 years, however, water softener systems can last much longer if they are correctly preserved. Making certain the salt water tank never lacks salt will extend the system's life.  Securing the resin bed from high levels of iron and manganese will also safeguard the system. Iron will foul the resin and lower its ion exchange efficiency. Resin cleaners improve the regrowth cycle and help relieve the resin beads of hardness-causing minerals.</p>
