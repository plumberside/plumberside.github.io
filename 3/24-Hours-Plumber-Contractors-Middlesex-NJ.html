<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer set will be attached to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally planned for the disposer discharge elbow. If your kit only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not recommended - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow utilizing a slip joint. The consecutive 90 Â° turns in such a setup can lead to improper drainage. Depending on the length of the waste arm, you may be able to cut off its elbow and utilize the remainder as a straight discharge tube.</p>
<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it avoids the need to dig up your yard. Throughout a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable down sewer branch lines that lead from tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images recorded by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as blockages, tree root invasion, misaligned joints, cracks, and other damage.</p>

If it occurs, this distinctive aroma allows you to smell a possible leak. Always leave if you suspect a leak.</p>
<p>Plumbing is a crucial part of your home or company, and its ability to function is vital. If you experience frequent problems with your plumbing, like drains blocking, this might be an indication of a bigger issue, like a tree root invasion or a large clog. If the drains clog periodically but you can typically flush them out, this may be a smaller sized clog like an accumulation of grease from the kitchen, or hair and soap scum from the bathroom. Little blockages can turn into huge ones relatively quickly.</p>

<p>Frequently caused by slow seepage from the tank into the bowl. Put a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank. Wait an hour, then inspect and see if you see coloring in the bowl.

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the tough water into the tank. The water leaks through the bed of resin beads, transferring the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and flows through your pipes and out to your household appliances. Backflow is a term used in the plumbing world to explain an undesirable flow of water in the reverse instructions. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it unsafe to drink.</p>
