<p>Kitchen sinks are constantly susceptible to blockages with food and grease being the major perpetrators. If fats are put down the sink, they harden to the piping walls. Food follows the grease down the plumbing, connecting to the walls too. Even tree roots can create serious drain blockages by wrapping around pipes. Their crushing strength stops the water flow, forcing plumbers to discover and repair the concern for typical home plumbing operations. If this is what is taking place to your house, you need your drain cleaned before it leads to further damage and even costlier repairs.</p>
