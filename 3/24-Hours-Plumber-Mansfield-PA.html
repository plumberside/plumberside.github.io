<p>Contrary to what many think, having a waste disposal unit in fact secures your pipes and extends their life expectancy. Food washed down a drain mistakenly or on purpose without a disposal can get stuck in pipe turns, causing obstructions and slowly harmful your plumbing system. Tiny food particles produced by a waste disposal unit wash straight down easily.</p>
<p>Without a plumbing camera inspection, many drain concerns can only be discovered once they start to support.

<p>Soap - Soap builds up down the drain since they usually include grease and fat.
