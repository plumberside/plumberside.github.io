A totally different disposal, or for installing your first disposal, the sink port needs to be puttied into place. A safe seal is a must.

<p>In the meantime, however, we recommend you first try utilizing non-harsh and non-abrasive white vinegar and lemon juice with baking soda. Simply put a cup of baking soda into your toilet bowl, add some white vinegar and lemon juice, and let the mix sit for a while. You can try a non-abrasive toilet bowl cleaner if that does not work. Many of these cleaners consist of concentrated levels of hydrocloric acid, which can be extremely harmful if it comes in contact with skin, eyes, or lungs. If utilizing one of these items, please make sure to take the suitable preventative measures.</p>
