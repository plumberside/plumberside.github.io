<p>It is approximated that the typical person invests over 3 years of their life sitting on the toilet, and lots of bathroom readers are at threat of ending up being permanently attached to the fixture. Which is why choosing a comfortable, reliable toilet seat is very important. Nevertheless, you have to ensure your toilet seat really fits your toilet. Most of toilets are standard sized - implying a "will fit" seat is sufficient for security and comfort. Some toilets, however, have uniquely formed bowls and require a specific seat, like the Eljer Symbol. It actually isn't a good idea to use a toilet seat that is either much too huge or much to small, unless they have been particularly developed to fit regular toilets, as the toilet seat can wobble and cause you to move around, or won't disperse your weight equally and could eventually trigger cracks in the bowl.</p>
