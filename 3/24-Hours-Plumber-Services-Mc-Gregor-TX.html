<p>Backpressure may take place when the potable supply piping is linked to a system or component which goes beyond the operating pressure of the supply piping. Greater pressure can be triggered by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or elevated piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, non-potable and safe and clean water or liquids can be pushed into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>When sewer line breaks, it often causes the lawn above it to become soggy. You may smell the revolting odor of sewage before you feel the squish of your lawn under your feet (ideally shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that portion of your yard. Since the swampiness will bring in unwanted animals, the situation is fraught with problems. Plumbers describe a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Hopefully, your Evanston plumber's contact number is on your speed dial.</p>
