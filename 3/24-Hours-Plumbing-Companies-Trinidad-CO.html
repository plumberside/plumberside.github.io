<p>A decreased pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high danger" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens.
