It's important to understand that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much greater pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, downstream or upstream, will prompt a properly operating RPZ assembly to periodically release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this factor, RPZ assemblies should not be set up in areas subject to water damage. Appropriate drainage must also be offered.</p>
<p>Your storm drains do not go straight into the ground and into oblivion either, this water is typically carried somewhere else to a neighboring treatment plant, a creek, or even the ocean in. Through the storm drain system there are long, flat sections of pipe that can be prone to clogging since there simply isn't enough a high enough flow to flush out the particles.</p>

<p>A minimized pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is installed in high risk" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however also has a third check valve that is really a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve offers an extra layer of protection compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you evaluate an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
