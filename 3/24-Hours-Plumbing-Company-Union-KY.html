<h3>How Much Does A Plumber Cost Union KY</h3>
<p>These guys were remarkable! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was set up 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company since they had fantastic evaluations and a fair cost, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were beasts. They had a substantial, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>
