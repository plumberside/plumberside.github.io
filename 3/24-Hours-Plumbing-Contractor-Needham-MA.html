<h3>Plumbing, Drains & Water Cleanup Needham MA</h3>
<p>These people were fantastic! They showed up early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem off and on for several years now. It was set up 7 years earlier, and it never ever drained this well. I picked this company due to the fact that they had fantastic reviews and a reasonable rate, and despite the fact that the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, revolting mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it as well.</p>
