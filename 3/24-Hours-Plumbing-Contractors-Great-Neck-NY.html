<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is essential to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the drawback shut down remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to transfer to their pressurized positions in an accurate motion. When the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air must be eliminated from the body. Most backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from important areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to get rid of air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will accumulate.</p>
