Such connections take place naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashers, but they should be carefully designed and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>

Water will always flow toward the point of lowest pressure. If a water main were to break or if the fire department opened numerous fire hydrants to assist fight a fire, the pressure in the water main might drop. The demand upstream could cause a turnaround in flow.</p>
