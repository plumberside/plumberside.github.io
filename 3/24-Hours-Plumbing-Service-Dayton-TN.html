<p>When the components are placed back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on slowly while the downside shut off remains in the closed position. This allows the parts to move to their pressurized positions in a precise movement. Once the assembly is pressurized, then any collected air needs to be removed from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be eliminated from crucial locations in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be used to eliminate air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a place where the air will accumulate.</p>
