<p>The economics of brand-new high-efficiency water softeners. The technician switched off the water system and loosened the bolts that were holding the toilet to the floor. He was then able to get rid of the pipe to clear the clog and reattach the pipe to the toilet component. The consumer helped our service technician in moving the toilet back into its correct location, and the technician tightened up the bolts before restoring the water supply and ensuring that the toilet was properly flushing.</p>
