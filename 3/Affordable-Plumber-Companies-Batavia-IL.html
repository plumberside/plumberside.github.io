<p>A. Usually wax doesn't "spoil" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leakages. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak originating from beneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or full blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is broken in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" unnoticed problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a couple of hours.</p>
<p>If you notice low water pressure or stained water, it normally signifies rust and mineral buildup. As rust and minerals develop gradually, they restrict the circulation of the water which is why you may notice lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and circulation into your water system, impacting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or rust can become a health danger in your water.</p>
