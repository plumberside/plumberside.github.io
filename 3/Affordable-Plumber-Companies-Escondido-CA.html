<p>A partial reroute is essentially a small scale repiping of several affected areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason why we will suggest a full repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
<p>Additionally, problems with the sink need to also be attended to instantly in order to prevent water damage and rotting under the system. If your sink is cracked, has sustained other damage, or has a broken drain basket, you may wish to forgo kitchen sink repair for a complete kitchen sink replacement.
