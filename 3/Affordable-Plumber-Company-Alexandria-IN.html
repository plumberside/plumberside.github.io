<p>An overall repipe of a house's water system, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and complex plumbing job, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on whole home repiping. Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were fantastic. My 90 year old Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos reached 8am the next day to repair. It was a difficult task because of the age of the house and area of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to make certain the system was working before they left. I am genuinely grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
