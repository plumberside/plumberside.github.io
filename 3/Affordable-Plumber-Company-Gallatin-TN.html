Boosts in downstream pressure can be produced by pumps, temperature level increases in boilers, and so on.

<p>Backflow implies the undesirable reversal of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable water system; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, but they need to be thoroughly created and set up to avoid backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water system.</p>
