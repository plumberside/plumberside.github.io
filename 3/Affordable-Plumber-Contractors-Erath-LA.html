<p>When sewer line breaks, it typically triggers the yard above it to become soggy. You may smell the horrible odor of sewage prior to you feel the squish of your yard under your feet (hopefully shoed feet!). A sinkhole can form, making it necessary to cordon off that portion of your lawn. Since the swampiness will draw in undesirable animals, the circumstance is stuffed with problems. Plumbers refer to a sewer line break as a plumbing emergency. Ideally, your Evanston plumber's telephone number is on your speed dial.</p>
