<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's safe and clean water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature increases in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>

When a new home is developed, water pipes need to be run, and toilets, faucets and sinks need to be installed correctly and to local, state, and federal code.

Having the drain back up or the foul odor of a malfunctioning sewer drain in your house is more than an inconvenience, it makes whatever else stop. When this happens you need a plumbing company that can get there fast. Determine the full magnitude of the problem, and fix it quick.</p>
