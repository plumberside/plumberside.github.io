In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, attics and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a complete repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
<p>Organic debris, such as hair, grease, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the cause of clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a newbie's DIY job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
