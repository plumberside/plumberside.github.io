<p>Many chefs choose to cook with gas on the stove top and electric in the oven. Electric ovens tend to bake goods more uniformly. Natural gas is also preferred due to the fact that it can be a green" or clean energy source.

<p>Remodeling plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one male and a truck. Again, this does not include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their quotes are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this approach, you understand the turnkey cost entering into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
