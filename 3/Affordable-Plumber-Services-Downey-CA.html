<p>Echologics has a long history of establishing award-winning acoustic technologies for leak detection on buried water pipelines. Running a camera through the household sewer pipes (generally from the house to its connection to the public sewer system) can be used to assess the type and condition of underground pipes, and to determine problems like leaking or broken joints, intruding roots, obstructions, corrosion or collapsed pipes. Homeowners may have a video inspection done to find the cause of periodic sewer backups or other continuous problems, or when offering or purchasing an older home.</p>
<p>Pipes can last anywhere from 20 to 70 years depending on the material. To maintain your home, security, and health comfort, we utilize just the best piping: polyethylene. Many houses and companies use galvanized pipes for water flow, which tend to degrade and can adversely affect our health. Copper is also frequently utilized because of its durability and much safer construction, however polyethylene piping lasts longer than anything on the market and guarantees the healthiest and cleanest water circulation.</p>
