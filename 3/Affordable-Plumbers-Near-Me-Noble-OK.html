<p>Check Valves and Double Checks. There are 2 other types of backflow preventers readily available that you may encounter. The first is a check valve. The second is a dual check". It is NOT the same thing as a Check despite the fact that it may be marketed as one! Don't get duped! Pressure loss through a check valve tends to be about 3 PSI. Double Checks have losses comparable to Check (5 PSI).</p>

<p>Keeping your trash dispoal clean isn't really hard or time consuming. Fill the sink at least half loaded with soapy water.
