It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a 3rd check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The factor it is utilized in high-risk circumstances is because if the first check valve ever malfunctions, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of defense compared to the DC, which will enable backflow if both check valves malfunction. This is the reason that when you check an RPZ, you require water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
