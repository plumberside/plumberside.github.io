<p>The secret to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is small amounts. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a reasonable quantity, there should be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a couple of food items you must probably not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to keep an eye out for excess grease and oils. Those fluids will solidify when they cool so it is best to wash pots and pans that have those liquids under warm water and to continue to let the water run for a number of seconds after you are completed cleaning to make sure the drain is clear.</p>
