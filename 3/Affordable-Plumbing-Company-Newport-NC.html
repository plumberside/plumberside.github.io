<p>If the toilet can not be repaired, or if the repair cost approaches replacement cost, we'll discuss your choices. Chemical drain cleaners are a popular approach of clearing clogs.

<p>The next requirements to evaluate is how the backflow prevention assembly is installed. It is necessary that the repair specialist understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to guarantee there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be installed in the installation orientation for which it was approved. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, however it is important that the assembly only be set up if it is approved for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work appropriately and no matter the number of parts you put inside the assembly, it still may not work because the installation orientation is causing the failure.</p>

We must take this step in order to guarantee your security and the security of the surrounding neighborhood.
