<p>In some families, using a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog might be the go-to technique when searching for a practical solution, particularly when easy plunging doesn't seem to work. Nevertheless, there are lots of drawbacks to using these hazardous items - not least of which is that they typically contain substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a blockage, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral accumulation, little things, dirt, and even roots in cases where split pipes on your home draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them reliable, but at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and family.</p>
