<p>George from Clog Dawg was professional, effective, and an excellent person. He told me precisely what to expect (cost, time, process) up front and delivered as guaranteed. I will absolutely utilize Clog Dawg once again. Setting up a waste disposal unit takes 2 to 3 hours with an average per hour rate of $25 to $70. These prices remain in addition to the cost of the disposal unit. The total you pay might be greater if your plumber has a minimum callout fee that is greater than the labor cost for the work.</p>
