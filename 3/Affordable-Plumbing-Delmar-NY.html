<p>The trick to preventing a clogged garbage disposal is moderation. As long as the food waste is sent through the disposal at a sensible amount, there must be no problem in getting the majority of the waste through. There are a few food items you should most likely not take into the garbage disposal though. Those items are coffee grounds, corn husks, banana peels and eggshells. Another idea to stop clogging is to watch out for excess grease and oils.

<p>Organic particles, such as food, hair, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unblocks P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can try to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's DIY job. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and trigger other leaks - so it deserves it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>
