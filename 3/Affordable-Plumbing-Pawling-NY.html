<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most obvious indications of a sewer problem is a smell of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be an easy problem such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house.

<h3>What To Do About Burst Pipes In The Middle Of The Night Pawling NY</h3>
<p>Another common argument versus the need for backflow preventers is that if all the valves are closed the water can't go backwards through them, so the valves should avoid backflow.  The apparent issue with this is that if the backflow occurs at a time when the valve is open, like when the sprinklers are on, the valve will not stop backflow!  What if the valve is closed?  A standard manually operated valve should stop backflow when it is closed - if the valve if fully closed, has good seals, and does not leak.  However the majority of the automated valves, such as the electrical solenoid valves utilized for irrigation systems, will not stop backflow even when off" and completely closed.</p>
<p>This is very essential! When you have cast iron drain lines you need 3-5 gallons of water that an older toilet supplies to press the waste out of your drain system.
