<p>Changing your sink is a detailed procedure. Procedure, cut, and link the pipes. Before attaching any pipes to your water softener, procedure and cut your pipes to fit. Solder on any nipples and fittings before linking the unit to the bypass valve to avoid melting the plastic if you are using copper pipes. Seal all threads with plumber's tape. Plastic tubing like PEX can likewise be utilized. Though it might require extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to work with and can make use of push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the hassle of soldering.</p>
