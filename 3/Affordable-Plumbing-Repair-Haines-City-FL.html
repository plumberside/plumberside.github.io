<p>A. If you have rust areas, using phosphoric acid typically will help eliminate them. , if you would like to try the gentlest approach possibly try using some Coke on the rust initially.. No, we aren't joking, Coca-Cola consists of a trace quantity of phosphoric acid. To attempt this, drain the toilet bowl to below where the rust marks are. Then pour on some Coke. Wipe with a soft fabric and after that more Coke, over and over, and so on.
