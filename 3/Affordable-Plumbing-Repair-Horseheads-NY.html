AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electric or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are set up on each zone of the watering system, right away after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as simple as replacing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that particular assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
