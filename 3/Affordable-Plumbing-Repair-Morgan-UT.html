<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that floats at the end of a rod, gently listen and lift the rod. If the water turns off, you might be able to stop the running by changing the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float change screw on top (see Figure A listed below). Flex the float arm if there is no modification screw. If you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve, ensure it's changed effectively (Photo 8). You don't need to empty the tank to make these adjustments.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair might be as easy as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates data on the operations of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's task to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester interprets the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
