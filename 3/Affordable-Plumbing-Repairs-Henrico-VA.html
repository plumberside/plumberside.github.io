<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's safe and clean water system.

Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water system pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being utilized goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
