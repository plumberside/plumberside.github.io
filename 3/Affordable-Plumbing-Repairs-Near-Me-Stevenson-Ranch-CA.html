<p>Sewer linings can help to repair split pipes without needing to entirely replace your sewer lines or destroy the area around them. Day to day usage must not cause a water softener to leak. Leaks can likewise occur if you run into the softener and scramble it, pulling the fitting apart. To prevent this from happening, install the system in a steady and safe place. If you reside in an earthquake-prone area of the country, protect the softener so that if the structure starts moving, the softener doesn't tip over and remove the plumbing. If your water softener is leaking during regrowth, you must wait until after the cycle is finished and then checked the system for cracks or broken fittings. You should also inspect to make sure your drain line is never ever blocked up with debris. A clogged drain line can blow off of the softener throughout regrowth and flood your basement or garage.</p>
