<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where fixing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, completion result is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can add up in cost really rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>
