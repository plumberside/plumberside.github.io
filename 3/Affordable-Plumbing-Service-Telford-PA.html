<p>The very best source for this type of plumber is a general contractor. The contractor sees the plumber's work prior to it's covered; you don't get that opportunity. In addition, your contractor understands the indications of quality work that you may miss out on, like clean solder joints, crisp 90-degree angles at joints and clean, properly sized holes in floors, joists, and studs. Finally, a quality contractor will not risk working with an inferior plumber. A basic mistake-- a joint left unsoldered or a leaky PVC line-- can easily devastate $10,000 worth of walls or wood floorings and make complex the job with insurance claims, lost time, and claims. With a lot riding on the plumber, contractors tend to stick with only the very best.</p>
