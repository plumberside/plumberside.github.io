It is necessary to comprehend that RPZ assemblies, while more reliable, experience much higher pressure and volume loss than double-check assemblies. Variations in line pressure, upstream or downstream, will trigger an appropriately functioning RPZ assembly to occasionally release small amounts of water. During a backflow condition, a big volume of water will stream from the relief valve. For this reason, RPZ assemblies shouldn't be set up in locations subject to water damage.

<p>Once the parts are positioned back into the body, the backflow prevention assembly is ready to be pressurized. It is necessary to turn the inlet shut-off valve on gradually while the downside turned off remains in the closed position. This permits the parts to relocate to their pressurized positions in a precise motion. As soon as the assembly is pressurized, then any built up air must be eliminated from the body. Many backflow prevention assemblies have air bleeds or air screws so that air can be removed from critical areas in the assembly. In some designs, test dicks can be utilized to remove air from an assembly if they are near the top of the body or in a location where the air will build up.</p>

This is why it is important to call a plumber as quickly as you think you have a leak or a broken tank part. Not just does a leaking toilet drainage, it can likewise lead to flooding and water damage.</p>
