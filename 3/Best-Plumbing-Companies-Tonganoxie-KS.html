<h3>Commercial Plumbing Services, Available 24/7 Tonganoxie KS</h3>
<p>In water circulation systems, water is typically preserved at a significant pressure to make it possible for water to stream from the tap, shower, or other fixture. Water pressure may be or fail reduced when a water main bursts, pipes freeze, or there is unexpectedly high need on the water system (for instance, when numerous fire hydrants are opened). Minimized pressure in the pipe may allow polluted water from the soil, from storage, or from other sources to be drawn up into the system.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are considered safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or debris in the water line avoids them from closing totally, backflow can take place.</p>
