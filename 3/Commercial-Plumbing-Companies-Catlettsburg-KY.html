<p>Your kitchen sink is an essential part of your home, that makes its plumbing's efficient functioning a need more than a need.

When the system is pressurized, air must be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are totally open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has been returned to service.</p>
