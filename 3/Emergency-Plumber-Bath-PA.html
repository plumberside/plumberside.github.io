<p>Backflow is bad news. The harsh water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are difficult on water pipes. Over a period of time the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>Current advances in toilet innovation have made modern-day restrooms much more comfortable and practical. If your toilet was made prior to 1994, then it's likely costing you money every day.

<p>Low pH also increases the corrosiveness of water. pH is the measure of hydrogen ion activity in a service and is used to reveal the intensity of the level of acidity of a service. Solutions with a low pH (< 7) are acids; solutions with a high pH (> 7) are bases. Acids are compounds that release hydrogen ions, which oxidize the metals in pipes, speeding up deterioration Carbon dioxide will possibly add to the development of carbonic acid, thereby making the water more destructive. The existence of high levels of carbon dioxide tends to correlate with particular geologic conditions.</p>
