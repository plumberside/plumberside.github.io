<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>Backflow is bad news. The severe water conditions in Orlando and Central Florida are tough on pipes. Over a time period the within lining of the pipe will weaken and a little pinhole leak will develop.

<p>If the problems takes place well outside that 8 to 12 year life-span, a guideline of thumb is that you can recapture the cost of the repair. If, state, you need a new burner set and the hot water heater is 5 years of ages, then it makes sense for you to invest the $120 for the part, specifically if you can do the work yourself. The closer the appliance is to that 8 to 12-year limit, the more doubtful the economics of a repair ends up being. The reason is that some other part on the home appliance will go or its tank will leak. And there's no treatment for a leaking tank.</p>
