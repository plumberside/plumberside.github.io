For instance, backflow at unrestrained cross connections (cross-connections are any potential or real connection between the general public supply of water and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow toxins or impurities to go into the drinkable water supply. Sickness can arise from consuming water that has been infected due to backflow.</p>
<p>Whether a water system is identified "soft" or "tough" depends on the presence of 2 highly soluble minerals, calcium and magnesium. From a health viewpoint, these minerals have no negative impacts and are, in fact, necessary day-to-day nutrients.

Nevertheless, when calcium and magnesium penetrate water, they buildup on contact surfaces, potentially plug pipes and damage hot water heater, and decrease the efficiency of soaps and cleaning agents. At this point the water is said to be tough.</p>
