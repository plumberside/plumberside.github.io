<p>Homeowners often ask if a gas water heater or an electric system is more affordable. The answer depends upon your house. While gas designs are more economical to run, they do require an existing gas line. The price tag of an electrical water heater is typically lower, but it can be more pricey to operate. Electric ranges are also easier to install, and unlike gas units, they are less most likely to lose heat.</p>

He also has to be able to operate in a completed environment.
