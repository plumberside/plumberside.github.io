Pumps can produce increases in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean supply of water pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
