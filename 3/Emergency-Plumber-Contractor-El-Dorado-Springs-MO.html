As soon as the test results reveal the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated throughout the repair process. It is very important that the plumbing system be turned on very slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be examined to guarantee no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately. As soon as the plumbing system is pressurized, be sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been returned to service.</p>
