<h3>How to Ensure Drain Cleaning Services Are Performed Correctly in Standish ME 04084</h3>
<p>Backflow means the unwanted turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the potable water supply; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water supply are called cross connections. Such connections happen naturally in home appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
<p>When a flush valve triggers a toilet to run, a worn flapper is typically the culprit. However not always. First, take a look at the chain that raises the flapper. If there's too much slack in the chain, it can tangle up and prevent the flapper from closing strongly. A chain with insufficient slack can cause problem too.
