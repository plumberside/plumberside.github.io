<p>The program accomplishes its objective by offering the adoption and promulgation of appropriate guidelines and policies for the construction of plumbing centers where mandated. Cold showers? High energy bills? It might be time for a new warm water heater. However in order to reap the benefits of a brand-new energy-efficient appliance, you'll need to have it installed effectively. A hot water heater that is not installed correctly can result in water damage, scalding temperatures, or perhaps a fire.

<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to just desert the affected area of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will suggest a full repipe in specific areas, based on our experience.</p>
