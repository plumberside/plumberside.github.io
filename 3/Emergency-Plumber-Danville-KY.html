<p>Another common misperception is that calcium-carbonate scale is a reliable form of rust control. There is an absence of clinical evidence supporting this claim, however. Scale does not form in uniform homogeneous layers that would safeguard pipe from deterioration Scale can be soft or permeable and is highly irregular.

By turning a valve, you can bypass the softener in the event you have to offer some sort of maintenance to it and even while you're working on installing it.
