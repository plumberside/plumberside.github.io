While particle size decrease and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not get rid of minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can only change the downstream results that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of certain systems has actually revealed a reduction of calcium scale formation. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
