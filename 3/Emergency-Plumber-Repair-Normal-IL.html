<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with difficult water, you might not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you have actually recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too familiar with the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from hard water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, causing you to utilize more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can result in dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water triggers your skin to flake, itch, and redden frequently.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can happen with time from the accumulation of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes. As a clog ends up being larger with time, it obstructs the pipe, stopping water from draining effectively. You can combat difficult water in various methods, consisting of filtering it by distillation or reverse osmosis, adding a packaged chemical softener such as powdered borax or washing soda (salt carbonate), or running it through a water softener.</p>
