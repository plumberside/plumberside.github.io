Pumps can develop increases in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, and so on. Decreases in potable water supply pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire combating, or breaks in water mains.</p>
