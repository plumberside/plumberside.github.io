<p>Organic debris, such as grease, hair, or food stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself project.
