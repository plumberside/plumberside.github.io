<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow brought on by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's safe and clean water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water system pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the drinkable water system pressure, or a combination of both. Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water system pressure occur whenever the quantity of water being utilized surpasses the quantity of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, fire fighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
