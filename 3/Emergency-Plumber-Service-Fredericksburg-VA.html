<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most typical way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool called a plumber's cable, drain or snake auger. The tool is carefully placed down your drain to clear it of buildup.

<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, however likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent available to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure).
