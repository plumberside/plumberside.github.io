<p>Hot water heater diagnostics: We determine what is wrong with your hot water heater, as well as what maintenance work requires to be carried out progressing. Water softeners generally utilize salt (Na+) as the exchange ion. Sodium ions are supplied from dissolved salt chloride salt, also called salt water. In the ion exchange process, salt ions are used to coat an exchange medium in the softener The exchange medium can be natural zeolites" or synthetic resin beads that look like damp sand.</p>
<p>Commercial toilets and urinals are a few of the most important functions of a business. Consumers can leave your company with an unfavorable impression if urinals and toilets do not operate appropriately. Leaking toilets cost cash, damage commercial home, and causes harmful slippery areas. Waste water is associated with possible health risks, consisting of undesirable odors and unsanitary conditions. A clogged toilet can provide a poor experience for your customers.</p>
<p>If you discover low water pressure or discolored water, it typically signifies rust and mineral accumulation. As rust and minerals develop with time, they constrict the circulation of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure.
