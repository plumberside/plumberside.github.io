<p>A. Generally wax doesn't "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to avoid leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet is there to prevent smells. If you are experiencing a leak coming from underneath the floor-mounted toilet, you most likely have a partial (or complete blown) toilet stoppage down the drain line (or the toilet is split in the bowl). Likewise, make sure the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "typical" undiscovered issue. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, attempt putting a few drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>Soap - Soap develops down the drain because they generally include grease and fat. When the fat of the soap integrates with mineral water, it forms a strong residue and sticks to the pipes, obstructing them. Call and schedule a follow up inspection by an EBMUD Backflow Inspector to confirm that assembly is properly installed. The toilet is the most used plumbing fixture in your home. The frequent use of your toilet indicates that plumbing problems will require your prompt attention. We offer professional Jacksonville Toilet Repair and Replacement services, and are on call when you need us.</p>
<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the hard water is softened. The water system line feeds the hard water into the tank. The water seeps through the bed of resin beads, depositing the water-hardening calcium and magnesium ions. The water exits the tank soft and streams through your pipes and out to your household devices. Backflow is a term utilized in the plumbing world to describe an unfavorable circulation of water in the reverse direction. The backflow of water carries impurities back to the primary supply of water system, making the water in it risky to drink.</p>
