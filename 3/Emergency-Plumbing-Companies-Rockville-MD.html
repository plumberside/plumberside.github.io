Toilets save lives. It may sound crazy, however it's true.

<p>Throughout sewer camera inspection, a Bob Oates service technician inserts a high-resolution camera with a light attached to it into the sewer line at your residential or commercial property. The camera is manually controlled on a flexible rod, or driven through the pipes on a tractor. The high-resolution light provides a clear image for the technician to accurately examine conditions and diagnose the functionality of the pipes.

<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing underneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost reliable, it is possible to only abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, attics and ceilings. Costing less than a complete repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely rapidly. This is the main reason that we will advise a complete repipe in certain communities, based on our experience.</p>
