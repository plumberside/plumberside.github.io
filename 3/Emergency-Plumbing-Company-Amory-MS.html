<p>Aside from these two crucial components, there are a myriad of small, maybe less crucial things that can break or degrade. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will rust far more rapidly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't raising appropriately, you might need a new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and cause a leak. If mishandled, tank covers can break and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this will not affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in excellent shape for it to work at its best.</p>

Prior to you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it deal with your toilet.
