<p>House water softeners, also called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. Once the resin beads end up being full of calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium service gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After passing through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>
<p>A clogged drain can make any of your plumbing components inoperable. Whether you have a sink that does not drain appropriately or a shower that holds water for too long, a Sears Handyman can assist.
