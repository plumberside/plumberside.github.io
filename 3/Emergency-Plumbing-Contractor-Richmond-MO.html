<p>Some manufacturers declare that the electrical devices they produce can affect the interaction of minerals with water so that the minerals do not bind to surface areas. Considering that these systems do not work by exchanging ions, like standard water softeners do, one advantage claimed for the user is the removal of the need to add salt to the system. While particle size reduction and plant development promo have been declared, such systems do not remove minerals from the water itself. Rather, they can just alter the downstream effects that the mineral-bearing water would otherwise have. Testing of particular systems has shown a decrease of calcium scale development. 11 These systems do not fall within the term "water softening" but rather "water conditioning".</p>
