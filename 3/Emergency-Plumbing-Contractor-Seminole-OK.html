<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regeneration. It is a much shorter tank that sits adjacent to the mineral tank. The brine tank holds a highly focused service of salt (or in some cases potassium) to bring back the resin beads' favorable charge.

When the control valve registers the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water option is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank. If the brine tank lacks salt, the water travelling through the system will no longer be softened.</p>
