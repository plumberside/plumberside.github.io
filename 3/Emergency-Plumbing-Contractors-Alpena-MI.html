<p>Garbage Disposal Installation Fed Up With False Guarantees? Water distributes in the tank where small resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads act as a sponge, adsorbing the solidity minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). During this process, the resin beads are washed with the extremely concentrated saltwater solution (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The salt water requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with salt or potassium ions.</p>
