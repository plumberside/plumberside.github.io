Pumps can develop boosts in downstream pressure; temperature level increases in boilers, etc. Decreases in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the quantity of water being utilized exceeds the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
