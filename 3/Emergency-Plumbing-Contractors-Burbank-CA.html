<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep sodium, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is swapped for the hard water minerals. The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
<p>These issues can be taken care of except for cracks in the body or interior lining of the disposal. You will need to install a brand-new garbage disposal if this is your problem.
