<p>Water softening uses a procedure called "ion exchange" to eliminate dissolved hard water minerals such as calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. These minerals can't be trapped by a filter, so a molecular reaction is required.

The tough water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener amount of sodium drains with the softened water.</p>
