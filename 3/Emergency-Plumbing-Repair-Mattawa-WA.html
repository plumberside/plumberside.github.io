<p>Waste Disposal Unit Installation Tired of False Promises? Water flows in the tank where tiny resin beads switch the calcium and magnesium in the water for the salt or potassium they're holding. The beads function as a sponge, adsorbing the hardness minerals from your water. This procedure is referred to as ion exchange, and soft water is the result. When the resin beads have maxed out their ability to hold calcium and magnesium, it's time for them to be recharged (a process called regeneration). Throughout this process, the resin beads are washed with the highly focused saltwater option (brine) from the tank (made from the salt you added to the tank). The brine requires the calcium and magnesium ions to be released from the beads and replaced with sodium or potassium ions.</p>

<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of circulation of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is designed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a potable water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections take place naturally in appliances such as clothes washers and dishwashing machines, but they must be carefully designed and installed to avoid backflow. Another common place for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water main, to avoid pressurized water from streaming from the fire suppression system into the general public supply of water.</p>
