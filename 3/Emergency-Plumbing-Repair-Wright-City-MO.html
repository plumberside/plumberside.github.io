<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable type of backflow prevention device that is set up in high threat" applications. The RPZ resembles the DC. It has 2 spring checks, but also has a 3rd check valve that is in fact a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is because if the first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you test an RPZ, you force water to backflow to ensure the RPZ discharges.</p>
