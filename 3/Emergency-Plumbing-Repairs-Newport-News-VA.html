<p>I can't state enough good things about this company. Had a sewer repair needed and had a very short amount of time due to closing on a home sale. Every single person I experienced from Marquita doing logistics for my job to every member of the work crew. Friendly, interacted well, absolutely responsive and really cared to assist me through this extremely stressful task. All of the people I came across were good example for what a well run service organisation need to be. Much thanks and appreciation. You're terrific.</p>
<p>Loose flanges are generally the result of wood rot. The flange screws just will not hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best solution depends upon the degree of the rot. Utilize an ear-type repair ring if the rot is only under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might need to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
