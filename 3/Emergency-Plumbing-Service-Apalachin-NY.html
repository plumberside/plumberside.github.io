<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned and inspected and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some parts might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. A crucial thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is a very critical part of the design of each part. If the element is not repaired effectively, the guide might restrict the movement (rather than direct or steady) of the element, which might cause the part to not work to its abilities. Many times springs are erroneously blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element causing lower test results than what is needed.</p>
