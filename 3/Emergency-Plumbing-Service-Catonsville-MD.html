<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building permit is generally needed before a plumbing permit can be released. Soften just what you need to.

Before you install this sort of ring, hold it as much as the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You might have to cut off a couple of ears to make it work with your toilet.
