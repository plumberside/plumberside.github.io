However the intent of the code is to only connect installation and ITM requirements to systems where backflow preventers exist.</p>
<p>Like any household device, water heaters require regular maintenance to run safely and effectively. Routine water heater maintenance can also extend the life of the appliance and aid prevent unexpected leakages or other problems. The maintenance required for your hot water heater depends on area, design of the unit, quality of installation, water quality, and maker recommendations.

<p>Keep in mind: Hard water stops your washing cleaning agent from working efficiently due to the fact that tough water ions can bond with cleaning agent molecules to deactivate them.

Lastly, water containing the hard minerals and other waste gets flushed out of the system.</p>
