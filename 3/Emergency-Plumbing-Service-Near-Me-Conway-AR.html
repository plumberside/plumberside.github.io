<h3>Clogged Drains Driving You Crazy Never Call The Emergency Plumber Again Conway AR</h3>
<p>To identify if your home is a poly home," start with the exterior. Underground water mains are usually blue in color (they can likewise be gray or black). The pipe is generally 1/2 to 1-inch in diameter. Often, it enters the home near the water heater. Your main shut off is attached to the end of the water pipe. Make sure you check both ends of the pipe. We have found cases where the copper pipe goes into the home and polybutylene is at the meter.</p>
<p>To make it simple, homeowners with testable backflow gadgets are supposed to have them evaluated by a certified tester every year.
