The repair may be as simple as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he creates information on the operations of the assembly.

When a qualified tester interprets the data, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and needs repair.</p>
