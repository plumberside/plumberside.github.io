<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous if I shut down the water under the sink. I discussed that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The cost was rather reasonable. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was extremely pleased with their service.</p>

Some fill toilet valves have a float modification screw on top (see Figure A listed below). If there is no adjustment screw, bend the float arm. Make sure it's adjusted appropriately (Picture 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not need to clear the tank to make these modifications.</p>

Difficult water causes these concerns due to the minerals in the water that are left behind after a wash.
