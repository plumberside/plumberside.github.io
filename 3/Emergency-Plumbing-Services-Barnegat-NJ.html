<p>A camera inspection takes the guesswork out of sewer and drain maintenance. Plus, it prevents the need to collect your yard. During a video camera inspection, a sewer and drain service technician runs a video cable television down sewer branch lines that lead from bath tubs, sinks, and other drains into the main sewer line. Using the images captured by the camera, we can determine any sewer and drain line problems, such as obstructions, tree root intrusion, misaligned joints, fractures, and other damage.</p>
