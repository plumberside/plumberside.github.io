<p>Backflow is a potential issue in a water supply since it can spread polluted water back through a distribution system. For instance, backflow at uncontrolled cross connections (cross-connections are any actual or possible connection between the general public water supply and a source of contamination or pollution) can allow contaminants or toxins to enter the safe and clean water system.
