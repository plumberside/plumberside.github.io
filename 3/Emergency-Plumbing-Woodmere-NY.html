<p>Figuring out if you need a water softener is a personal preference. Water softener systems work by removing firmness minerals and replacing them with salt ions. Water conditioners are devices that help prevent the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They use a physical media to hinder the scale from building up by neutralizing the hardness itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners utilize a physical media rather of a chemical media, they are in some cases thought about a greener option in locations where it is forbidden to utilize salt. Water conditioners do not successfully get rid of hardness from the water supply, however, as the only way to do this is with a salt-based media.</p>

<p>Tankless Water Heaters - offer warm water on demand without a tank.

<p>It helps to know the brand and model of your toilet. The trademark name is normally on the bowl behind the seat.
