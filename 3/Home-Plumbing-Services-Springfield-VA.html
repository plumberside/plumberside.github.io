<p>Don't put whatever down your garbage disposal. It is necessary to see what you put down your waste disposal unit. Foods like rice and pasta can swell when blended with water, and possibly cause a clog. Vegetables and fruit peels can likewise trigger jams and clogs - think about composting or positioning these items in the garbage.

<h3>Clogged Sink in Springfield Virginia</h2>
<p>Depending on what part of the world you're from you may have heard sink disposals described as garbage disposals," food waste disposers," or, if you're really appropriate, a sink waste disposal unit." Whatever you call it, changing one out or setting up a brand-new one is a relatively easy job.

<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is often the reason for clogged drains. The most common method a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool referred to as a plumber's snake, drain or cable auger. The tool is thoroughly inserted down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, however this isn't a novice's Do It Yourself job. If you use the tool improperly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leakages - so it's worth it to call somebody who knows the drill.</p>
