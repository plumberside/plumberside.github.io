<h3>How to Fix a Leaky Faucet from the Kitchen in Carthage MO 64836</h3>
<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you might not understand just how much it affects you-- but if you've recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Difficult water disrupts the lathering of soaps and hair shampoos, triggering you to use more. Hard water also makes it more difficult to wash soap off your body, or shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and itchiness of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely discover that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red often.</p>
