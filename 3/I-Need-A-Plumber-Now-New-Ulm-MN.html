<p>When the safe and clean supply piping is connected to a system or fixture which surpasses the operating pressure of the supply piping, backpressure may occur. Higher pressure can be brought on by booster pumps, boilers, pressure vessels, or raised piping in locations such as high-rise buildings or tanks. If these connections are not properly secured, drinkable and non-potable water or liquids can be forced into the potable supply system.</p>
<p>Chelation: Another method is to present a chemical substance that serves as a chelating representative. Magnesium and calcium bind to this chelating agent and stay suspended in the water instead of building up on surface areas. Nevertheless, if they stay in one location for long, as they may in a hot water heater, the buildup could still take place.</p>
