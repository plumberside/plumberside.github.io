<p><img src="https://plumbingimages.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/plumbing.jpg" alt=""><p>
<p>A total repipe of a house's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company specializing in entire house repiping. Current Review: Carlos and Lopez were remarkable. My 90 years of age Dad's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. Due to the fact that of the age of the home and area of the pipe, it was a difficult task. They worked for nearly 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working before they left. I am truly grateful for their effort and professionalism.</p>

Profiting from the distinct, thermal shape memory of Uponor's PEX-a tubing, fittings actually get stronger gradually. No need to stress over behind-the-wall connections - ProPEX joints will last the life of the building.</p>
