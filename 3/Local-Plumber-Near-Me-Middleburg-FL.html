<p>If you've constantly lived in an area with tough water, you may not understand how much it impacts you-- but if you've just recently moved from an area with soft water, you're most likely all too knowledgeable about the dry, irritated skin and frizzy, dull hair that can arise from difficult water. Hard water disrupts the lathering of soaps and shampoos, triggering you to use more. Tough water also makes it harder to clean soap off your body, or hair shampoo out of your hair, which can lead to dandruff and irritation of your skin or scalp. If you have chronically dry skin or eczema, you'll likely find that hard water causes your skin to flake, itch, and turn red typically.</p>

In Kingman, people use warm water for everything from doing the dishes to taking a relaxing shower, and even going one day without it provides an enormous trouble. If you're having problems with your existing hot water heater-- or you need to get a brand-new one-- don't try to handle it alone.  Call Plumbing by Jake.</p>

<p>The mineral tank is the chamber where the difficult water is softened. The supply of water line feeds the hard water into the tank.
