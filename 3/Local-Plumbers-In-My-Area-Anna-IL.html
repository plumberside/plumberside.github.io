<p>Numerous property owners believe their energy companies or homeowners insurance is responsible for emergency repairs to the water, sewer, plumbing, electrical, heating and cooling systems, but the truth is that in most cases you, the property owner, are responsible. The majority of fundamental property owners insurance plan and local utility companies or municipalities do not cover repairs to or replacement of the major systems in and around your house.</p>
