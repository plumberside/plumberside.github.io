<p>Backflow means the undesirable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended strong into the potable water system; a backflow preventer is created to keep this from occurring. Points at which a potable water supply gets in touch with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in devices such as clothing washers and dishwashing machines, however they must be carefully created and installed to prevent backflow. Another common location for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire lawn sprinkler to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the general public water system.</p>
