<p>When water is hard, it can clog pipes and soap will liquify in it less quickly. Water softening can prevent these negative impacts. Natural gas is a colorless, odorless fuel. As a safety preventative measure, we add a chemical odorant called mercaptan that gives gas a smell often associated with rotten eggs. If it occurs, this distinct scent enables you to smell a possible leak. If you think a leak, constantly leave.</p>
