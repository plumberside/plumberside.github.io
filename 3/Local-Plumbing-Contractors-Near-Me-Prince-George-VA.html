However, the majority of toilet repairs are uncomplicated and basic tasks - such as changing a used flapper - that many people can do themselves in about 5 minutes.

<p>The next criteria to assess is how the backflow prevention assembly is set up. It is necessary that the repair technician understands the proper installation orientation and can examine the installation conditions to make sure there are no conditions preventing the working of the assembly. The backflow prevention assembly must be set up in the installation orientation for which it was authorized. The majority of backflow preventers are installed in a horizontal orientation to the surrounding grade. Some (not all) backflow preventers can be installed in a vertical orientation, but it is very important that the assembly just be set up if it is authorized for that orientation. To arbitrarily take an RP and stand it on its end in a vertical orientation might trigger the backflow prevention assembly to not work properly and no matter how many parts you put inside the assembly, it still might not work since the installation orientation is triggering the failure.</p>
