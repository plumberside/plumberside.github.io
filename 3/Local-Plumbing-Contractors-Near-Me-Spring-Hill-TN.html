A common example of this is when galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe. It is also worth keeping in mind that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the space in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it also will not entirely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be utilized to reduce this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
