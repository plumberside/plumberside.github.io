<p>Aside from these two crucial elements, there are a myriad of small, possibly less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can show you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can cause a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner functions exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it definitely doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by mentioning all the important things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part needs to be in great shape for it to work at its best.</p>

There are times when our plumber needs to remove the toilet to unclog the drain correctly.</p>
