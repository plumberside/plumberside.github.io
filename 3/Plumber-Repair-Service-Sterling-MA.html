The repair might be as basic as replacing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or might require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he produces information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's duty to know what the field test data suggests for that specific assembly.  When a trained tester analyzes the information, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and requires repair.</p>
