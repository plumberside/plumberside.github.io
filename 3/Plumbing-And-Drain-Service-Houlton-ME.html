<p>A total repipe of a house's water system, frequently done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most detailed and expensive plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping. For an outdoor gas light or appliance whose gas supply line is buried, water leaking into the gas line can cause a clog or can cause corrosion that blocks the line. Simply 4" of water pressure can be enough to obstruct a gas line. Sound-- Gradually sediment can develop in the bottom of your tank. This sediment eventually gets difficult and takes away from the capability of your hot water heater. This solidified sediment is most likely the source of the noise.</p>
