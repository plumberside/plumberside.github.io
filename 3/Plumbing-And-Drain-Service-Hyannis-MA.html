<p>Your kitchen sink is an integral part of your house, that makes its plumbing's effective working a necessity more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is complete, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated during the repair procedure.

As soon as the system is pressurized, air needs to be eliminated from the plumbing system. When re-pressurized, each outlet on the plumbing system should be inspected to make sure no valves were inadvertently left open or did not close effectively. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are completely open and inform the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
