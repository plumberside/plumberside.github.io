<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge at least $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this does not consist of the cost of parts. But increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the fixtures themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest much more. With this method, you know the turnkey rate going into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>Disadvantages to be familiar with is that hybrid hot water heater need to be installed in an area that stays in between 40 to 90 degrees, or they will not work well. They need up to 7 feet of clearance from the floor to ceiling, because the heatpump is on top of the water heater. Also, hybrids require up to 1,000 cubic feet of uncooled area to catch enough heat from the air, and a drain in close distance to release the condensate.</p>
