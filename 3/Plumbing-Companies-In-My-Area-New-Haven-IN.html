<h3>Bathtub Repair in New Haven Indiana</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the walls, ceilings and attics. Costing less than a complete repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can add up in cost very quickly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
