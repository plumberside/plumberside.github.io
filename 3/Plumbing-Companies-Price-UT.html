<p>Backpressure backflow is backflow triggered by a downstream pressure that is higher than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or customer's potable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is greater than the safe and clean water supply pressure) can arise from a boost in downstream pressure, a reduction in the potable water supply pressure, or a mix of both. Pumps can create increases in downstream pressure; temperature level boosts in boilers, etc. Reductions in drinkable water supply pressure take place whenever the quantity of water being used goes beyond the amount of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, fire battling, or breaks in water mains.</p>
