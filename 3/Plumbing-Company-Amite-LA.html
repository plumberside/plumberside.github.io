For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away far more quickly. Consistent gross smells coming from the toilet can indicate you need a brand-new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. If the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting appropriately, you may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve. Bulges in the supply line can burst and trigger a leak. If mishandled, tank lids can break and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed.

All plumbing needs to have their tests on at the time of inspection or the plumber should license the plumbing was evaluated on the test form on the right side of this page.</p>
