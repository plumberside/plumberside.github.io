<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, which makes its plumbing's efficient operating a requirement more than a need. Once the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was isolated throughout the repair procedure.

When the system is pressurized, air must be gotten rid of from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be checked to ensure no valves were unintentionally left open or did not close effectively when re-pressurized. Once the plumbing system is pressurized, make certain all valves are entirely open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has actually been gone back to service.</p>
