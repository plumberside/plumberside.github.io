Tank lids can split and leave your toilet's inner operations exposed if mishandled. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not trying to psych you out by pointing out all the important things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in good shape for it to function at its best.</p>
