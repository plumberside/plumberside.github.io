Examine to see if there is a buildup of mineral deposits in the tank, if possible. Mineral deposits can settle on the tank's bottom, leaving less room for water - which will suggest that less water will be heated and offered for usage. Likewise, rust of the tank's aspects can cause the tank to have a short life. If the water heater is old or you see apparent signs of rust, request that a new one be installed.</p>
