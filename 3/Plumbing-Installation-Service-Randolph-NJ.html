<p>When seeking a gas line installation in Dallas, therefore, you need to use trained and certified experts for all aspects of your plumbing and gas line installation. Once your plumber has actually set up a gas line, you'll desire an audit of the plumbing and installation to ensure that there are no gas leakages. This must be done prior to the plumber leaves the job. The audit will reduce the opportunities of a gas leak. Shut off the gas valves instantly if you do observe a pungent smell in your home after your plumber leaves. Ensure and leave the building that open fire does not get near your house up until a professional can fix the gas leak. Contact your gas energy company immediately.</p>
