It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is actually a vent open up to environment on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk situations is because if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then opens and drains.
