<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the inbound drinkable supply of water. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decline in the supply of water pressure. Backsiphonage happens when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, typically due to a disturbance or drain in the supply, such as water pipe repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity.
