<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement components, a building license is typically needed before a plumbing permit can be issued. Soften only what you need to. Individuals frequently choose to soften showers, sinks, and laundry connections. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be connected to a softener. In many cases, individuals choose to soften just the hot water.</p>
<p>The source or location of a sewer problem determines who spends for repair. The City is responsible for the public right of way (curb to suppress), from one side of the street to another. The homeowner is responsible for the area from the curb to the back of their residential or commercial property line. Easements (usually 10 feet large) where main sewers pass through personal property are an exception to this rule.</p>
<p>The Department of Buildings has actually set up kiosks in each District Office where the public can get support from Department staff to register and, if required, link their PIN in DOB NOW: Inspections. Broken toilet? No issue for our extremely trained plumbers. From toilet tank repair and leaking toilets to valve replacements, repairing leaking seals and wall mounted; there aren't any problems we can't resolve.</p>
