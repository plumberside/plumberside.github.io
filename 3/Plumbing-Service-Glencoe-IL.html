The repair may be as easy as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of a few of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester carries out a field test, he generates information on the operations of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information indicates for that specific assembly.  When a skilled tester analyzes the information, he can identify what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
