<p>You live in an older home. If your home is 50 years old or older and you've never replaced its pipes, there's a likelihood that you'll need to have it done soon. Galvanized pipes were usually set up in homes of this age, and these kinds of pipes are known to wear away and burst when they get old.

Preventive cleaning for drains must be performed on all drains, consisting of toilet, sink, tub and floor drains.</p>
