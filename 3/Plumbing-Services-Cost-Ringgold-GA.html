<p>Viking SupplyNet's extensive stock of backflow valves and associated gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water supply react with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being fragile. This leads to micro-fractures and reduces the fundamental structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, causing damage to the building structure and personal property. Improper installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost impossible to find.</p>

<p>3. Solar Salt originates from evaporated seawater and might often leave a pink "bio-film" or stain in tubs and sinks. The pink movie is actually a harmless bacteria that comes from the sea salt. If this stain is an annoyance in your home, the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) suggests changing to one of the other 2 types of salts. Once the new salt has had a chance to totally replace the solar salt in your system, then acquire some water softener filter cleaner to clear out your softener as advised in your owner's manual or on the cleaner label.</p>
