<p>A partial reroute is basically a small scale repiping of several affected locations of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where jackhammering and repairing the pipe are not cost effective, it is possible to only desert the afflicted area of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, walls and ceilings. Costing less than a full repipe, completion outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced houses having 2 or more slab leaks within a 1-2 year period, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason we will advise a full repipe in certain areas, based upon our experience.</p>

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems usually are set up in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as aircraft garages. Water to the system is held back by the deluge valve, which is connected to a fire detection system. If a fire happens, the detection system sends a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Button Plumbing was great. They replaced my kitchen faucet and added 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly dripped in the past if I shut down the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining slow. After the kitchen faucet was done, they entered into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were really friendly and got the work done quickly. The rate was rather reasonable. I will definitely utilize them for any future plumbing needs. I was super happy with their service.</p>
