The threaded water system shank that fits through the bottom of the tank is not included in this measurement. The addition of a backflow preventer decreases water service pressure to the structure; extra, more significant costs can take place if the drop in water pressure becomes an issue for residents. A PE or RA can help figure out if installing a pump or bigger size water service and backflow prevention device would combat the pressure loss.</p>
