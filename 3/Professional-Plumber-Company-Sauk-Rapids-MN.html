Water conditioners are gadgets that help avoid the hardness-forming minerals from forming scale. They utilize a physical media to prevent the scale from building up by reducing the effects of the solidity itself. Due to the reality that water conditioners use a physical media instead of a chemical media, they are in some cases considered a greener alternative in locations where it is forbidden to use salt.
