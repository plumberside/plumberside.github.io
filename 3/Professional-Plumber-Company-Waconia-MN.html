<p>Your garbage disposal ensures that your sink and plumbing components do not get clogged. Contrary to some people's understanding, garbage disposals do not include blades. Instead, a garbage disposal features 2 fixed bolts that are repaired to a spinning disk.

This high-speed action effectively pulverizes the food waste in the disposal so that it can travel down the drain without blocking.</p>
