<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water supply or consumer's drinkable water supply. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable water supply pressure) can result from a boost in downstream pressure, a decrease in the potable supply of water pressure, or a combination of both. Increases in downstream pressure can be developed by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean water supply pressure happen whenever the amount of water being used exceeds the amount of water being provided, such as during water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water mains.</p>
