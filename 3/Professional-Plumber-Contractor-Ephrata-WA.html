Recent Evaluation: Carlos and Lopez were amazing. My 90 years of age Father's sewer line clogged on Thanksgiving Day and Carlos came to 8am the next day to repair. It was a hard task because of the age of your home and place of the pipe. They worked for almost 12 hours into darkness to ensure the system was working prior to they left. I am really grateful for their hard work and professionalism.</p>
<p>Do not put whatever down your waste disposal unit. It is very important to view what you put down your garbage disposal.

Fruit and vegetable peels can also trigger jams and clogs - think about composting or positioning these products in the garbage. In addition, grease and oil can gather and cake in your drain also. After finishing cooking, think about putting remaining grease or oil into a jar or bowl to reserve. You can then use and reheat for other cooking or easily place in the garbage after it's hardened.</p>
