<p>The brine tank aids the water softening system in regrowth. It is a much shorter tank that sits surrounding to the mineral tank. The salt water tank holds an extremely concentrated solution of salt (or often potassium) to restore the resin beads' favorable charge. Salt is by hand added to the salt water tank in the kind of blocks or pellets. These liquify in the water at the bottom of the tank. When the control valve signs up the softening capability of the resin is lessening, the heavy salt water solution is extracted of the tank and flushed through the resin in the mineral tank.
