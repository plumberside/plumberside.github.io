If the rot is just under the flange, use an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into company wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this type of ring, hold it approximately the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. If the rot extends well beyond the flange, you'll have to replace a section of the subfloor.</p>

You, therefore, need to use increasingly more cleaning agent to attain the same cleaning power. The media gets a bath in the salt option. Tough minerals caught in the resin (or zeolite) are released and the media gets replenished with salt ions. The water softener is also cleaned up and decontaminated during regrowth. Finally, water consisting of the difficult minerals and other waste gets eliminated of the system.</p>
