Homes integrated in the first part of the 1900s were plumbed using lead pipes. At that time, people had no concept that the lead in the pipes could leach into the drinking water, let alone the health dangers related to lead.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers generally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this doesn't consist of the cost of parts. However increasingly more plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily spend far more. With this method, you understand the turnkey rate going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
