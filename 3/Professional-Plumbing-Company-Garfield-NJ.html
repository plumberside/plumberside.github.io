Within the galvanic cell, the more anodic metal will be worn away and an electrical current is created because of the process. When galvanized pipe is straight connected to copper pipe, a common example of this is. It is also worth noting that while utilizing a brass fitting to bridge the gap in between galvanized and copper pipe will not accelerate this galvanic activity, it likewise will not completely avoid it.4,5,6 Dielectric couplings can be used to mitigate this direct contact between the dissimilar metals.
