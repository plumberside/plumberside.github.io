<p>If your flapper valve has a ball that drifts at the end of a rod, gently lift the rod and listen. If the water shuts off, you may be able to stop the running by adjusting the float. Some fill toilet valves have a float adjustment screw on top (see Figure A below). If there is no change screw, flex the float arm. Make sure it's changed properly (Image 8)if you have a Fluidmaster-style fill valve. You do not have to empty the tank to make these modifications.</p>
<p>You need to spend a minimum of $50 to get a high-quality kitchen sink basket strainer assembly with a reliable stopper and a resilient finish system. The best strainers have either a spin-lock or a twist-and-drop design stopper. The spin-lock stopper doesn't have any parts that can wear, but screwing it in and out can be frustrating. The twist-and-drop design is much easier to utilize but needs occasional -ring replacement.</p>
