The activation of a faucet requiring hot water triggers the heater and water is heated up as it streams through a heating coil or heat exchanger. Since they can hinder the blades, cooking oil and other greases ought to never ever be put down the garbage disposal. Lastly, cold water must be running when the garbage disposal is on and should continue to run for 30 seconds after the disposal is turned off to ensure that all food particles have been rinsed through the pipes.</p>
