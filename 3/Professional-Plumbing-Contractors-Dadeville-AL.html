<p>Discover more about our current specials on plumbing, rooter, sewer, drain service and more. You'll notice the difference the first time you bathe or shower with softened water. Soft water feels visibly smooth to the skin. It likewise makes your home easy to clean by decreasing hard-water build-up. Just Hire a Licensed Plumber Too often, our plumbers are repairing work that was done poorly the first time. Selecting your plumbing contractor on a price basis alone is not adequate. Just a licensed plumber can perform test and installation of new gas lines.</p>
<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Once again, this does not include the cost of parts. However more and more plumbers are charging "by the fixture," and their bids are based on the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and fixtures for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can quickly spend a lot more. With this technique, you understand the turnkey price going into the task, and any surprises are the plumber's duty, not yours.</p>
