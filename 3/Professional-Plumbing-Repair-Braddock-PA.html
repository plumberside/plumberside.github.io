<h3>Plumbing Repairs & Services In Braddock PA</h3>
<p>These people were remarkable! They appeared early and stayed late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been a problem on and off for several years now. It was installed 7 years back, and it never ever drained this well. I chose this company because they had great reviews and a reasonable cost, and even though the job took a lot more time and work than they expected it to, they honored their quote. I will utilize Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing needs in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, horrible mess on their hands (literally), and they did a terrific task cleaning up after it also.</p>
