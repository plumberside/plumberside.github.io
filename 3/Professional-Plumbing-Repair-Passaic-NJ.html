<p>Backpressure backflow in a structure results when the pressure in the system is higher than the pressure of the incoming drinkable water system. Backpressure can be brought on by pumps or temperature level boosts in boilers, or if there is a decrease in the water system pressure. Backsiphonage takes place when negative or lower pressure develops in the supply piping and forms a vacuum, usually due to a disruption or drain in the supply, such as water main repairs or breaks, or close-by firefighting activity. To avoid backflow, a backflow preventer device is installed on each main water service line-- domestic and fire water-- feeding the structure. A typical type of backflow preventer is the reduced pressured zone (RPZ) assembly.</p>
