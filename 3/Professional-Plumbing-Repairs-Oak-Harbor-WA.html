<p>Backflow is a possible issue in a water system due to the fact that it can spread contaminated water back through a circulation system.

Illness can arise from consuming water that has actually been polluted due to backflow.</p>
<p>The calcium from limestone is the significant contributor to the solidity of Woodbury's water.
