<p>Whether changing an old one or putting one in for the first time, there are a couple of things worth knowing about garbage disposal installation. You count on your water heater every day for all the warm water you and your family need to cook, clean, and shower. When your water heater quits working effectively or if it's time for an upgrade, count on Essig Plumbing & Heating.

From hot water heater repairs to regular maintenance to complete replacement, our plumbing professionals have you covered.</p>
<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the faulty pipes replaced. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes replaced, which is where whole-house repiping can be found in. This is an alternative to think about if you reside in an older home - such as one built pre-1970 - or any house with galvanized steel plumbing. Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for many years, however steel eventually experiences corrosion and lacks the resilience these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>
