<p>As soon as the hardware parts have been cleaned up and examined and the rubber parts have been replaced, now reassemble the parts back into their components. Some elements might have extremely tight tolerances that have to be kept. An important thing to identify on each component is the guide. The guide is the part that directs or steadies the movement of the element. The guide is an extremely critical part of the design of each component. If the element is not repaired properly, the guide could limit the motion (rather than constant or direct) of the part, which might trigger the part to not work to its capabilities. Often times springs are incorrectly blamed when there is a low differential on a check valve, or a relief valve will not open. In many cases the guides are limiting the travel of the element triggering lower test results than what is needed.</p>
