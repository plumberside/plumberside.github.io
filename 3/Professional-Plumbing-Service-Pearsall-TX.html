<p>In this situation, filthy water from the hillside swimming pool will back- siphon or back-flow down the hosepipe and into the clean water tank. You likewise need to buy a backflow valve if you see your water has an unusual circulation, taste, color or odor. A plumbing professional can figure out whether the problem with your faucet is a quick fix or the result of other concerns in your home's plumbing system. More complicated concerns with water temperature or pressure might require replacing the hot water heater, which normally costs $350-$ 3,500, depending on capacity and type.</p>
<p>The person who does the testing must be a certified backflow tester. Not all licensed plumbers have this accreditation, and a plumbing license is not needed to get this certification. I've checked with a couple of plumbers, and the estimate for backflow testing varied from $150 - $250, but I would anticipate the price to be considerably less from backflow testers who are not licensed plumbers.</p>
