<p>Sinks aren't as basic as they used to be. Nowadays, house owners can select from a dizzying range of sinks for the kitchen, bath, wet bar, utility room, and more. In the bathroom, you may have a pedestal sink, a wall-mounted sink, a vanity sink, a self-rimming sink, an undermount sink, a console sink, or a vessel sink. A clogged kitchen sink is normally an indication of an obstruction in the plumbing system. If the obstruction isn't eliminated, water pressure can build up within the pipe, ultimately causing it to burst.</p>
