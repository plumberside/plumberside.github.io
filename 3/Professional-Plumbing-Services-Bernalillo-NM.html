Your plumber may replace the tank-to-bowl connections, or the gasket around the floor hole. Compared to the day-to-day expenditures and frustrations sustained by hard water, a water softener is eventually an investment that will conserve you a significant amount of cash. The cost of the water softener system is considerably exceeded by the money and energy conserved.</p>
