<h3>Broken Toilet in Commerce Georgia</h2>
<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of several afflicted areas of the plumbing below the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just abandon the afflicted section of pipe and reroute the line through the attics, ceilings and walls. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that might leak once again in the future. We have actually experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost extremely quickly. This is the main reason that we will recommend a full repipe in certain neighborhoods, based on our experience.</p>
