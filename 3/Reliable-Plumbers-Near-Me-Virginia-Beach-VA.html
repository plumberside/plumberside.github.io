<p>Clark's Process: This process is also called lime softening. The chemical calcium hydroxide, called limewater, is added to water, which causes the solidity ions to speed up. The alkalinity of the water is raised through this addition to above 9.6, so carbon dioxide should be contributed to re-carbonate the water and bring the pH back down. When it concerns pipe repair, the most expensive elements aren't the equipment or materials used, but the lawn, landscaping and uprooting damage that ensues.</p>

Our repair procedures depend on having a clean, smooth pipeline, otherwise, imperfections brought on by waste buildup can avoid the liner from sticking to the walls correctly. We clean the sewer lines with hydro jetting, a service that permits a detailed cleaning by blasting streams of hot, pressurized water directly into the line. The unique nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all instructions to allow the water to cover the entire diameter of the sewer line and supply a careful cleaning.</p>
