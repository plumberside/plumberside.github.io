<p>Loose flanges are normally the result of wood rot. The flange screws simply won't hold in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best option depends on the degree of the rot. Use an ear-type repair ring if the rot is just under the flange. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Before you install this sort of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may need to cut off a number of ears to make it deal with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
<p>We concentrate on repair, service and installation of all makes and designs of gas hot water heater, electrical water heaters and tankless water heaters.

Give the professionals at Wingate a call to repair your running toilet and minimize squandered water.</p>
