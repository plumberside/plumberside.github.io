<p>You depend on your drains to bring wastewater from your tub, sink or shower. Over time, the drains end up being clogged with residue such as mineral sediment, food, hair, grease and more. These products gather in the drain and ultimately harden versus the pipe walls, making them challenging to get rid of. Your water heater is leaking: Water heater leakages are among the most common indications that your unit is at the end of its lifespan, particularly if they are causing major flooding or are originating from the tank itself.</p>

<p>Martens Plumbing & Heating provides a range of sewer and drain piping repair and replacement services. A clogged sewer line can result in a raw sewage backup out of your drains, which can trigger significant problems and damage-- especially common in older homes. Using a sewer camera to inspect the weak locations or clog, our highly trained specialists can rapidly find the source of the issue keeping your sewer line from doing its task-- effectively transferring wastewater to your sewage-disposal tank or municipal system.</p>
<p>In regards to the equipment that will be examined, there are two possible choices: a minimized pressure concept device or check valves. Both include a mechanical backflow preventer - basically, a physical barrier to the backflow.
