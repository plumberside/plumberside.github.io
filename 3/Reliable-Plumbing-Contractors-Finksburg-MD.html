<p>Loose flanges are usually the outcome of wood rot. The flange screws just won't keep in the soft, decayed subfloor. The very best service depends upon the level of the rot. If the rot is just under the flange, utilize an ear-type repair ring. The ears let you drive screws into firm wood farther away from the flange. Prior to you install this kind of ring, hold it up to the drain horn on the underside of the toilet. You may have to cut off a number of ears to make it work with your toilet. You'll have to replace a section of the subfloor if the rot extends well beyond the flange.</p>
