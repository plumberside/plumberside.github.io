<p>Improvement plumbers normally charge a minimum of $45 to $65 per hour for one guy and a truck. Again, this doesn't include the cost of parts. However a growing number of plumbers are charging "by the component," and their bids are based upon the rough-in for drain and supply lines ($ 300 to $400 in my area) and installation of the components themselves (about $200). Plumbing parts and components for a powder room with a sink and toilet run $1,000 to $1,200, though you can easily invest a lot more. With this method, you understand the turnkey price entering into the job, and any surprises are the plumber's responsibility, not yours.</p>
<p>A number of companies, such as the American Water Functions Association (AWWA) and the American Backflow Prevention Association (ABPA) offer certification courses developed to train specialists to test backflow preventers. Requirements for training vary by jurisdiction. Inspection of backflow preventers requires understanding of installation requirements, although inspectors are not required to end up being certified.</p>
