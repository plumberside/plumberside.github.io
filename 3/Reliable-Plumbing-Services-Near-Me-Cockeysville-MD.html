<p>Foul Sewer Odor: One of the very first most apparent signs of a sewer issue is an odor of sewage when you flush the toilet, or in the backyard (in the area where your sewer line would be). This can be a simple issue such as a broken water seal, or it can show a bigger issue such as a broken sewer pipe. Drain repairs can avoid major damage to your house.
