<p>Your kitchen sink is an important part of your house, that makes its plumbing's efficient operating a necessity more than a need. When the test results show the repair is total, it is time to re-pressurize the plumbing system that was separated during the repair procedure.

Once the system is pressurized, air should be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system should be checked to make sure no valves were mistakenly left open or did not close appropriately when re-pressurized. When the plumbing system is pressurized, make sure all valves are totally open and notify the water user that the plumbing system has been gone back to service.</p>
