For example, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will corrode much more rapidly. Continuous gross smells coming from the toilet can suggest you need a new wax ring where your toilet connects to the floor drain. You might need a new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting correctly. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst.

While this will not impact the function of your toilet, it definitely does not do much for the visual of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by mentioning all the things that can fail, the point is - your toilet is a complete fixture and every part requires to be in excellent shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
