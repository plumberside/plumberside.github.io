<p>You live in an older home. There's a good possibility that you'll need to have it done quickly if your home is 50 years old or older and you've never ever replaced its pipes. Galvanized pipes were usually installed in homes of this age, and these types of pipes are understood to corrode and burst when they get old. If so, you may need to add a grounded outlet to power the waste disposal unit if you do not already have one. This usually adds anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the total cost of the waste disposal unit installation.</p>
<p>Do not utilize ground joint unions except straight at the meter or after the shutoff valve at the appliance. Each place where you will have a gas appliance should have a gas shutoff valve. Within the City of Seattle only, anyone who installs gas piping on residential or commercial property not under their ownership should have a Seattle Gas Piping Mechanic License. All gas piping setups require a permit and inspection.</p>
