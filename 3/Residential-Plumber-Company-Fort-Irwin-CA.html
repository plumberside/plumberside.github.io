If I shut off the water under the sink, they changed my kitchen faucet and included 2 brand-new shut off valves under the sink which had actually constantly leaked in the previous. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains completely. They were very friendly and got the work done quickly. The price was quite reasonable. I will absolutely utilize them for any future plumbing needs.
