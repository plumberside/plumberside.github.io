<h3>The Many Services Provided By Residential Plumbers New Haven MI</h3>
<p>The most efficient way to address hard water is with a water softener. Water is softened when calcium and magnesium-- the solidity ions-- are collected by tiny resin beads through a procedure called ion exchange. The resin beads are charged with salt or potassium ions. When tough water is available in contact with the resin beads, the calcium and magnesium are taken out of the water and changed with sodium or potassium, leaving your water soft.</p>
<p>6. Install the new sink flange, gasket and rings. All sinks (and toilets) have drain traps, called P-traps, that keep sewer gas from entering your home. Plumbers can replace or fix blocked or leaking P-traps to keep them operating appropriately. Leaking pipes can impact your indoor air quality.
