<h3>Drain Pipe Repair in Foley Alabama</h2>
<p>If a gas water heater or an electric unit is more affordable, property owners often ask. The answer depends upon your home. While gas designs are less expensive to operate, they do require an existing gas line. The price of an electric water heater is generally lower, but it can be more costly to run. Electric varieties are likewise much easier to install, and unlike gas systems, they are less likely to lose heat.</p>
<p>House water softeners, likewise called ion exchange systems, are home appliances that get rid of calcium, magnesium, and other minerals from drinking water. Resin beads inside the softener trap the calcium and magnesium and exchange them for salt or potassium. As soon as the resin beads become loaded with calcium and magnesium, a highly-concentrated salt or potassium solution gets rid of the calcium and magnesium from the beads. After going through the beads, the resulting chloride option becomes a waste stream that goes down the drain and ultimately into the environment.</p>

Anything you pour down there won't go through when something blocks the pipes.</p>
