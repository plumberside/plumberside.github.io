<p>Depending on your water quality, some softeners may be able to totally or partially get rid of copper, iron, manganese, and radium, in addition to calcium and magnesium. Note that copper can reenter the water after if leaves the softener and passes through your house's pipes and plumbing.

<p>Deluge systems are designed so that all the sprinkler heads are open and the piping is not pressurized. These systems generally are installed in areas where the possibility of a severe fire condition is likely, such as airplane garages. Water to the system is kept back by the deluge valve, which is linked to a fire detection system. If a fire takes place, the detection system sends out a signal that opens the deluge valve, which then enables water to release from all of the sprinklers on the system.</p>

<p>Whenever the pressure on the residential or commercial property (downstream) side surpasses the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- avoiding any backflow. Nevertheless, while DCV systems are thought about safe for many fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves fail or particles in the water line prevents them from closing completely, backflow can occur.</p>
