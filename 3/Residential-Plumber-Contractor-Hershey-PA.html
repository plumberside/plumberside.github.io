<p>A lowered pressure zone backflow device (RPZ) is a testable kind of backflow prevention device that is installed in high threat" applications. The RPZ is similar to the DC. It has two spring checks, but likewise has a third check valve that is really a vent open to atmosphere on the bottom of the valve (kept closed by the water pressure). The reason it is utilized in high-risk scenarios is due to the fact that if the very first check valve ever breakdowns, the bottom of the valve then drains and opens. This relief valve provides an extra layer of security compared to the DC, which will allow backflow if both check valves breakdown. This is the factor that when you check an RPZ, you force water to backflow to make sure the RPZ discharges.</p>
