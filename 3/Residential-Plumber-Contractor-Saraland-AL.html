<p>While fighting a fire, firefighters are not surprisingly more worried about drawing adequate water to douse the blaze than backflow prevention. Not only will they utilize water from any readily available source to achieve their objective, but fire department lorries typically carry non-potable water treated with antifreeze, deterioration inhibitors, or extinguishing representatives.</p>
<p>We have an inspection program to recognize water sources and circumstances that need backflow prevention devices. For house, it is essential for owners to inform the District if any modifications are made, such as digging a new well. For commercial home, the District examines the use of each brand-new occupant. If the present backflow is not up to District code, the correction should be made prior to water service is allowed. Cost for the device is covered by either the home or the tenant owner.</p>
