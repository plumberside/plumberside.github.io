AVB's can be plastic or brass and either electric or manual. Unlike other backflow preventers, AVBs are installed on each zone of the irrigation system, right away after the zone control valve.</p>
<p>Sometimes, an untrained person will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the presumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as simple as changing a few rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may require the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he produces data on the workings of the assembly.  It ends up being the tester's responsibility to understand what the field test information means for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly failed the test and needs repair.</p>
