Use a service of baking soda and vinegar periodically to keep your drains and garbage disposal clean. You can utilize an organic drain cleaner month-to-month to keep your drains clear. We advise organic products, such as Bio-Clean, since they work much better than items consisting of extreme chemicals and will not cause damage to your drains or components.</p>
