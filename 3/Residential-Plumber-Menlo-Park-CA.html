<p>An overall repipe of a home's water supply, often done to replace leaking polybutylene pipes, is the most costly and detailed plumbing task, says Steven Wood, president of Flo-Right Services, a plumbing company concentrating on entire home repiping.

The details we obtain from the inspection permits us to make a notified choice relating to the condition of your pipes and suggest the best option too.
