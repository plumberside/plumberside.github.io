<h3>Difference Between Plumbers And Plumbing Contractors Scappoose OR</h3>
<p>These men were fantastic! They showed up early and remained late to unclog our kitchen sink tht has actually been an issue off and on for years now. It was installed 7 years earlier, and it never drained this well. I picked this company because they had terrific reviews and a reasonable price, and although the job took a lot more time and work than they anticipated it to, they honored their quote. I will use Clog Dawg for any of my plumbing requires in the future. Randy, Kenny, and Ryan were monsters. They had a huge, disgusting mess on their hands (actually), and they did a great job cleaning up after it as well.</p>

This service is completely safe for your pipes and is understood to improve the overall health and longevity of your plumbing system.
