<p>The discharge tube included in the disposer kit will be connected to the disposer using the plate, gasket and screws originally intended for the disposer discharge elbow. If your package only includes a waste arm, it is possible - though not suggested - to connect this to the disposer discharge elbow using a slip joint. The successive 90 ° turns in such a setup can result in inappropriate drainage. Depending upon the length of the waste arm, you may have the ability to cut off its elbow and use the rest as a straight discharge tube.</p>

Natural gas is among the most typical and affordable types of energy to residential customers. Although relatively safe and extremely effective, consumers of gas must understand possible threats to much better safeguard their homes and households.</p>
<p>A. Generally wax does not "go bad" on a basic floor-mounted toilet, as its function is not to prevent leaks. Wax on a floor-mounted toilet exists to prevent odors. If you are experiencing a leak originating from below the floor-mounted toilet, you probably have a partial (or complete blown) toilet interruption down the drain line (or the toilet is cracked in the bowl). Also, make certain the leak isn't coming from above and dribbling down the back of the toilet, as this is a "common" undiscovered problem. If you aren't sure where the leak is coming from, try putting a couple of drops of food coloring in the tank and waiting a few hours.</p>
<p>A waste disposal unit lasts approximately 10 to 12 years. This average life expectancy computation assumes normal wear and tear of the system.

<p>In some homes, utilizing a chemical drain cleaner to fix a clog may be the go-to method when searching for a feasible option, especially when easy plunging does not seem to work. However, there are numerous drawbacks to utilizing these hazardous products - not least of which is that they usually include substances such as lye, caustic potash, bleach, peroxides, and even acids. These chemicals work by dissolving whatever is triggering a clog, which can vary from the typical suspects like hair or food to mineral buildup, small things, dirt, and even roots in cases where cracked pipes on your residential or commercial property draw the attention of plant life. The strength of these chemicals makes them efficient, however at the cost of providing the danger of damage to your house and household.</p>
