<p>A partial reroute is generally a little scale repiping of one or more affected locations of the plumbing beneath the slab. In cases where repairing the pipe and jackhammering are not cost efficient, it is possible to just desert the affected section of pipe and reroute the line through the ceilings, walls and attics. Costing less than a full repipe, the end outcome is that there will still be old copper plumbing under the slab that may leak again in the future. We have experienced homes having 2 or more slab leakages within a 1-2 year duration, and these repairs can accumulate in cost very rapidly. This is the main reason we will recommend a full repipe in specific communities, based upon our experience.</p>
