<p>Brine Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automated shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is almost certainly from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or natural gas is very low. Rainwater which has actually not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure form of water. When water vaporizes it leaves dissolved solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Strategy to replace the water heater right away if you identify a drip. Do not wait until the leak gets bad. A waste disposal unit provides a great convenience to your kitchen and cuts down on cleaning time.
