<p>Aside from these 2 crucial parts, there are a myriad of small, perhaps less crucial things that can break or deteriorate. For instance, if you lose your toilet bowl bolt covers (those little caps on the base of the toilet), the bolts holding your toilet to the floor will wear away a lot more quickly. Constant gross smells originating from the toilet can indicate you need a new wax ring where your toilet attaches to the floor drain. You may need a brand-new cap for the fill valve if the float rod of your fill valve isn't lifting effectively. Bulges in the supply line can trigger a leak and burst. If mishandled, tank lids can crack and leave your toilet's inner workings exposed. While this won't affect the function of your toilet, it certainly doesn't do much for the aesthetic of your bathroom. We're not attempting to psych you out by pointing out all the things that can go wrong, the point is - your toilet is a total fixture and every part requires to be in great shape for it to operate at its best.</p>
