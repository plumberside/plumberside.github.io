<p>Button Plumbing was terrific. They changed my kitchen faucet and added two new shut off valves under the sink which had always leaked in the previous if I shut off the water under the sink. I pointed out that my bathroom sink was draining pipes sluggish. After the kitchen faucet was done, they went into the bathroom and snaked the pipe that the sink drains into. Now the bathroom sink drains perfectly. They were extremely friendly and got the work done rapidly. The rate was rather sensible. I will absolutely use them for any future plumbing needs. I was very pleased with their service.</p>
