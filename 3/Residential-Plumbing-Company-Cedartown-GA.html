It is important that the plumbing system be switched on really slowly to assure no damage is done to the piping system. When the system is pressurized, air must be removed from the plumbing system. Each outlet on the plumbing system must be inspected to ensure no valves were unintentionally exposed or did not close effectively when re-pressurized.
