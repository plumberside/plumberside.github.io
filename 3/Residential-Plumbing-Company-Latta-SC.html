It is really difficult to evaluate such claims, which are practically never ever based upon tests that are well enough explained to permit others to examine them and to confirm the outcomes. While the lack of "scientific" proof does not in itself invalidate a claim for the efficacy of a device, it must make one be reluctant to accept it without some guarantee of performance.</p>

It might not work effectively all the time, however you can't tell if that's normal or not. Plus, there's that omnipresent but never ever unacknowledged feeling that it's you-you're in some way doing something wrong in there.</p>
