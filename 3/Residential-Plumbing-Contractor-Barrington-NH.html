When we needed a leak in a pipe repaired, I had an excellent experience with Gotelli Plumbing. Tom was professional and friendly.

The special nozzle attached to the hose directs the water in all directions to allow the water to cover the entire size of the sewer line and offer a careful cleaning.</p>
