<p>When you have plumbing problems with leaking or broken pipes, the typical option is to have the malfunctioning pipes changed. However, there are some cases where you will need to have all the pipes changed, which is where whole-house repiping is available in.

Steel was the most popular choice for home plumbing for lots of years, however steel eventually suffers from deterioration and lacks the toughness these days's copper, PEX, and CPVC piping.</p>

When drains are working correctly that's actually all you need to learn about them, but when something fails, you need to have a deeper understanding of what sort of problems can take place in pipes and how to fix them without doing more damage. That's where a professional plumber can be found in-- they have the knowledge to diagnose a problem and the tools and understanding to fix it.</p>
<p>Master plumber: To become a master plumber, a person must have a specific number of years' experience as a journeyman plumber, in addition to an associate's degree or training at an occupation school. A master plumber must pass an exam that normally encompasses both composed and useful knowledge. They need to also complete continuing education hours every year. Usually the business owner, a master plumber goes through inspection and needs to ensure all journeyman plumbers working for his/her company remain in compliance with plumbing policies.</p>
