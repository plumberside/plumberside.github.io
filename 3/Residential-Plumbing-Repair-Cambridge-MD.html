Water softening is achieved with SACr by using proprietary polymer beads to produce insoluble carbonate crystals from calcium and magnesium bicarbonates. The beads accelerate the development of carbonate crystals, which can be filtered to totally remove momentary hardness in water.</p>
<p>Drain clogs in bathroom sinks can occur gradually from the buildup of hair, bits of soap and fibers from towels that collects inside of pipes.
