<p>Backpressure backflow is caused by a downstream pressure that is greater than the upstream or supply pressure in a public water system or customer's drinkable water system. Backpressure (i.e., downstream pressure that is higher than the drinkable supply of water pressure) can result from an increase in downstream pressure, a reduction in the safe and clean water system pressure, or a mix of both. Boosts in downstream pressure can be created by pumps, temperature level boosts in boilers, and so on. Reductions in safe and clean supply of water pressure take place whenever the amount of water being used goes beyond the quantity of water being supplied, such as throughout water line flushing, firefighting, or breaks in water pipe.</p>
