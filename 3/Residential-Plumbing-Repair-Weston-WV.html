<p>Salt Water Valve - Controls water circulation in and out of salt tank. Functions automatic shut-off to prevent overfilling. Water in a gas pipe is likely from a leak, not from "condensation" as the water content of LP or gas is very low. Rainwater which has not infiltrated the earth is an incredibly pure kind of water. When water vaporizes it leaves behind liquified solids i.e. calcium and magnesium ions. For that reason when evaporated water eventually falls as rain - it is soft.</p>
<p>Outdoor plumbing for leakages or obstructions. After examining whatever indoors, your pro will then examine the outdoor plumbing.
