Fortunately, Mr. Rooter ® Plumbing is your local source for quality sewer repair and replacement at any time.</p>
<p>At any time the pressure on the property (downstream) side goes beyond the pressure on the city side, the two redundant check valves close-- preventing any backflow. However, while DCV systems are thought about safe for the majority of fire defense systems, they do have a defect: if both valves stop working or debris in the water line avoids them from closing completely, backflow can take place.</p>
