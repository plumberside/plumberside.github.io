<h3>Water Leak Detection Tips for Homes in Portage WI 53901</h3>
<p>Backflow implies the unfavorable turnaround of flow of a liquid, gas, or suspended solid into the drinkable supply of water; a backflow preventer is developed to keep this from taking place. Points at which a safe and clean water supply connects with a non-potable water system are called cross connections. Such connections occur naturally in appliances such as clothing washers and dishwashers, but they must be thoroughly created and installed to avoid backflow. Another typical area for a backflow preventer is the connection of a fire sprinkler system to a water pipe, to prevent pressurized water from flowing from the fire suppression system into the public water supply.</p>
