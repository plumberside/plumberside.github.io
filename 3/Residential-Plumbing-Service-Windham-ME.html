<p>You reside in an older house. There's an excellent opportunity that you'll need to have it done soon if your home is 50 years old or older and you have actually never ever changed its pipes. Galvanized pipes were frequently installed in houses of this age, and these types of pipes are known to rust and burst when they get old.

This normally includes anywhere from $75 to $150+ to the overall cost of the garbage disposal installation.</p>
<p>Often, an inexperienced individual will see the relief valve of an RP discharging water and make the assumption the backflow prevention assembly is not working.  The repair may be as basic as changing a couple of rubber parts (eg.  Discs or 'rings) or may need the replacement of some of the hardware parts (eg.  Seats or stems) inside the backflow prevention assembly.  When a tester performs a field test, he generates information on the functions of the assembly.  It becomes the tester's responsibility to know what the field test information suggests for that specific assembly.  When a qualified tester analyzes the data, he can determine what parts of the backflow prevention assembly stopped working the test and requires repair.</p>
