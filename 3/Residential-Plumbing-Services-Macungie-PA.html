<p>Numerous toilet problems, including leaking toilets, don't require fixing the whole toilet. Like any home device, a toilet tank includes lots of small moving parts that might need replaced with use over time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear and cause toilet leaks that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye. Toilet leaks around the base can also take place around the toilet gaskets (the bolts that seal the tank to the toilet bowl) or the wax ring listed below the base of the toilet.</p>
<p>So now that you understand you have a backup in your main line, how do you clear it? Sadly, main line clogs are not something a property owner can fix. This type of clog requires a professional plumber or drain specialist to utilize a drain cleaning machine to locate the clog and get it cleared. TLC can utilize a camera to see down into the drain line and locate the clog or break in the line. All TLC's Drain Cleaning Professionals are equipped with this kind of camera to identify and repair the drain problem. This type of camera is especially beneficial in locating an issue if you have a long sewer line from your home to the sewer system or septic tank.</p>
