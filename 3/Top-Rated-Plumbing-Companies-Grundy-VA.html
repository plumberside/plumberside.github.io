<p>Many toilet problems, including leaking toilets, do not demand fixing the whole toilet. Like any house device, a toilet tank includes many little moving parts that may need changed with use in time. Flapper valves, fill valves, and other tank parts can all wear out and cause toilet leakages that aren't plainly noticeable to the naked eye.

When something blocks the pipes, anything you pour down there will not go through.</p>
