<p>Changing your sink is a step-by-step procedure. Measure, cut, and connect the pipes. Prior to connecting any pipes to your water softener, step and cut your pipes to fit.

Plastic tubing like PEX can also be utilized. Though it may need extra adapters, flexible tubing is far easier to deal with and can use push-to-connect fittings, conserving you time and the trouble of soldering.</p>
