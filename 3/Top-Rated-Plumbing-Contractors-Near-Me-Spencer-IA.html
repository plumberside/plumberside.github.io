<p>For plumbing work other that repair or replacement fixtures, a building authorization is usually needed before a plumbing license can be provided. Soften only what you need to. People often select to soften showers, sinks, and laundry hookups. Toilets, hose bibs, basement sinks, and other cold water taps normally do not need to be linked to a softener. In most cases, individuals pick to soften just the warm water.</p>
