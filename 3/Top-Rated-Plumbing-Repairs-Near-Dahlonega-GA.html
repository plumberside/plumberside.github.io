<p>It typically symbolizes rust and mineral accumulation if you notice low water pressure or tarnished water. As rust and minerals build up in time, they constrict the flow of the water which is why you may discover lower water pressure. The discoloration takes place when rust ends up being loose from the pipes and flow into your water supply, affecting the water quality. Having plumbing pipes that have rust or corrosion can end up being a health risk in your water.</p>
<p>For example, a plumber on an online forum sponsored by tool maker Ridgid reports charging $125 for a camera inspection done as part of cleaning out a sewer line with a cable and cutting blade (called snaking) or $225 if done independently. And video inspection rates at Allied Drain Cleaning 1 in Connecticut start at $175, while Covenant Pipeline 2 in California charges a minimum of $275 for approximately two hours and $175 per hour for each extra hour.</p>
