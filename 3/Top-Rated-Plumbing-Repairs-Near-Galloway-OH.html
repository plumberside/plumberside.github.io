<p>Viking SupplyNet's substantial inventory of backflow valves and related gadgets consists of leading products from Wilkins, Ames, Watts, and others. Oxidants such as chlorine in the public water system respond with the polybutylene piping and acetal fittings, causing them to scale, flake, and end up being breakable. This results in micro-fractures and reduces the basic structural stability of the system. The system ends up being weak and might fail without caution, triggering damage to the building structure and personal property. Incorrect installation is also a common cause of polybutylene system failure, which can be almost difficult to spot.</p>

A clogged sewer pipe might leave you ripe for a drain-cleaning rip-off.</p>
