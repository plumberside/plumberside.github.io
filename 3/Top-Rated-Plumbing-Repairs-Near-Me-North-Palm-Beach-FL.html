<h3>Tips For Finding A Cheap Plumber North Palm Beach FL</h3>
<p>Backflow preventer installation requires the services of a licensed professional engineer (PE) or licensed signed up architect (RA), and licensed master plumber (LMP). A licensed professional can help you determine if your structure requires a backflow preventer or multiple gadgets, or if you qualify for an exemption. Exemptions, which are given in very unusual cases where the building is considered to not pose a threat to the water supply, must be filed with the DEP by a PE or RA on behalf of the property owner. If your structure has an existing backflow preventer, but the DEP has no record of its installation, you must have a licensed professional file a record illustration of the device, in addition to a preliminary test report of the device for DEP evaluation.</p>
