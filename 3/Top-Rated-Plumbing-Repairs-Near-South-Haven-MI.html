<p>Water softening uses a process called "ion exchange" to remove liquified tough water minerals such as calcium, iron, manganese and magnesium. These minerals can't be caught by a filter, so a molecular response is required. Water softeners have resin beads that keep salt, and as the tough water flows through the resin, the salt is switched for the difficult water minerals. The difficult water minerals are caught in a trace and the softener quantity of salt flows out with the softened water.</p>
<p>Organic particles, such as hair, food, or grease stuck in the sink drain's P-trap is frequently the reason for clogged drains. The most common way a plumber unclogs P-traps is with a tool known as a plumber's snake, cable television or drain auger. The tool is thoroughly placed down your drain to clear it of buildup. You can attempt to do this yourself, but this isn't a beginner's Do It Yourself task. If you use the tool incorrectly, you can harm your pipes and cause other leaks - so it's worth it to call someone who understands the drill.</p>

When designed in this manner it prevents siphoning and backflow into a water system.
